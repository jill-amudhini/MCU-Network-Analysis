Dr. Hank Pym,How s your face,4,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,After you,2,antman
Darren Cross / Yellowjacket,Now before we start I d like to introduce a very special guest this company s founder and my mentor Dr Hank Pym When I took over this company for Dr Pym I immediately started researching a particle that could change the distance between atoms while increasing density and strength Why this revolutionary idea remained buried beneath the dust and cobwebs of Hank s research I couldn t tell you But just imagine A soldier the size of an insect The ultimate secret weapon An Ant Man That s what they called you Right Hank Silly I know Propaganda Tales to astonish Trumped up B S to scare the U S S R Hank will you tell our guests what you told me every single time I asked you was the Ant Man real,134,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Just a tall tale,4,antman
Darren Cross / Yellowjacket,Right Because how could anything so miraculous possibly be real Well I was inspired by the legend of the Ant Man And with my breakthrough shrinking inorganic material I thought could it be possible to shrink a person Could that be done Well it s not a legend anymore Distinguished guests I am proud to present the end of warfare as we know it the Yellowjacket The Yellowjacket is an all purpose weapon of war capable of altering the size of the wearer for the ultimate combat advantage,88,antman
Video Voice Over,We live in an era in which the weapons we use to protect ourselves are undermined by constant surveillance It s time to return to a simpler age One where the powers of freedom can once again operate openly to protect their interests An all purpose peace keeping vessel The Yellowjacket can manage any conflict on the Geo political landscape completely unseen Efficient in both preventative measures and tactical assault Practical applications include surveillance industrial sabotage and the elimination of obstructions on the road to peace A single Yellowjacket offers the user unlimited influence to carry out protective actions and one day soon an army of Yellowjackets will create a sustainable environment of well being around the world The Yellowjacket,120,antman
Frank,So it s a suit,5,antman
Darren Cross / Yellowjacket,Don t be crude Frank It s not a suit it s a it s a vessel What s a matter you re not impressed,25,antman
Frank,Oh I m impressed I m also concerned Imagine what our enemies could do with this tech,17,antman
Darren Cross / Yellowjacket,We should have a longer conversation about that Frank I really value your opinion Thank you for coming Hope,19,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Thank you very much everybody I will escort you out now Thank you,13,antman
Darren Cross / Yellowjacket,You seem a bit shocked,5,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Darren there s a reason that I buried these secrets,10,antman
Darren Cross / Yellowjacket,So you finally admit it We could ve done this together Hank But you ruined that That s why you re the past and I m the future,28,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Don t do this,4,antman
Mitchell Carson,Dr Cross You sell to me first twenty percent of your asking price I can have the cash here in two weeks,22,antman
Darren Cross / Yellowjacket,Deal,1,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,We have to make our move Hank,7,antman

Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Yeah I m getting a little light it s funny hit me and,13,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Hello Who are you Have you been standing there watching me sleep this whole time,15,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Yes,1,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Why,1,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Because the last time you were here you stole something,10,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Oh Oh Hey look,4,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Whoa,1,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Paraponera clavata Giant tropical bullet ants Ranked highest on the Schmidt pain index They re here to keep an eye on you when I can t Dr Pym s waiting for you downstairs,33,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Who Hey um whose pajamas are these How am I supposed to do this,14,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Right just one step at a time,7,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Ugh You don t bite me I don t step on you deal,13,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Take down the servers and Cross wouldn t even know it We don t need this guy,17,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,I assume that you ve already met my daughter Hope,10,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,I did She s great,5,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,She doesn t think that we need you,8,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,We don t We can do this ourselves,8,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,I go to all this effort to let you steal my suit and then Hope has you arrested,18,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Okay we can try this and when he fails I ll do it myself,14,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,She s a little bit anxious It has to do with this job which judging by the fact that you re sitting opposite me I take it that you re interested in,32,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,What job,2,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Would you like some tea,5,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Uh sure,2,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,I was very impressed with how you managed to get past my security system Freezing that metal was particularly clever,20,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Were you watching me,4,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Scott I ve been watching you for a while ever since you robbed Vista Corp Oh excuse me burgled Vista Corp Vista s security system is one of the most advanced in the business It s supposed to be unbeatable but you beat it Would you like some sugar,49,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Yeah thanks You know what I m okay How do you make them do that,15,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Ants can lift objects fifty times their weight They build farm they cooperate with each other,16,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Right But how do you make them do that,9,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,I use electromagnetic waves to stimulate their olfactory nerve center I speak to them I can go anywhere hear anything and see everything,23,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,And still know absolutely nothing I m late to meet Cross,11,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Uh Dr Pym,3,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,You don t need to raise your hand Scott,9,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Sorry I just have one question Who are you Who is she What the hell s going on and can I go back to jail now,26,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Come with me Twenty years ago I created a formula that altered atomic relative distance,15,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Huh,1,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,I learned how to change the distance between atoms that s what powers the suit that s why it works,20,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Whoa,1,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,But it was dangerous It was too dangerous So I hid it from the world And that s when I switched gears and I started my own company,28,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Pym Tech,2,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Yes I took on a young prot g called Darren Cross,11,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Darren Cross He s a big deal,7,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,But before he was a big deal he was my assistant I thought I saw something in him a son I never had perhaps He was brilliant but as we became close he began to suspect that I wasn t telling him everything He heard rumors about what was called the Pym Particles and he became obsessed with recreating my formula But I wouldn t help him so he conspired against me and he voted me out of my own company,81,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,How could he do that,5,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,The board s chairman is my daughter Hope She was the deciding vote But she came back to me when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula The process is highly volatile What isn t protected by a specialized helmet can affect the brain s chemistry I don t think Darren realizes this and you know he s not the most stable guy to begin with,69,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,So what do you want from me,7,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Scott I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption Do you,12,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,I do,2,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,If you can help me I promise I can help you be with your daughter again Now are you ready to redeem yourself,23,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Absolutely My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done What do you want me to do,19,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,I want you to break into a place and steal some shit,12,antman
Maggie Lang,You going to be home for dinner tonight,8,antman
Paxton,Uh yeah I ll pick something up text you,9,antman
Maggie Lang,Okay Good news,3,antman
Paxton,Uh I don t know It s news,8,antman
Cassie Lang,Are you trying to find my daddy,7,antman
Paxton,Yeah I am sweetheart I just want your daddy to be safe,12,antman
Cassie Lang,Hope you don t catch him,6,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,This isn t the first time these guys have tried to get their hands on game changing weaponry That s Mitchell Carson ex head of defense at SHIELD presently in the business of toppling governments He always wanted my tech and now unless we break in and steal the Yellowjacket and destroy all the data Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world,64,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,I think our first move should be calling the Avengers,10,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,I ve spent half my life trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a Stark I m sure as hell not gonna hand deliver it to one now This is not some cute technology like the Iron Man suit This could change the texture of reality Besides they re probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky,61,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Okay then why don t you just send the ants,10,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Scott they are ants Ants they can do a lot of things but they still need a leader Somebody that can infiltrate a place that s designed to prevent infiltration,30,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Hank I m a thief Alright I m a good thief But this is insane,15,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,He s right Hank and you know it You ve seen the footage you know what Cross is capable of I was against using him when we had months now we have days I m wearing the suit,38,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Absolutely not,2,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,I know the facility inside and out I know how Cross thinks I know this mission better than anybody here,20,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,We need you close to Cross otherwise this mission cannot work,11,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,We don t have time to screw around,8,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Hope please Listen to me please,6,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,He is a criminal I m your daughter,8,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,No,1,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,She s right Hank I m not your guy Why don t you wear the suit,16,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,You think I don t want to I can t I spent years wearing it It took a toll on me You re our only option Before Hope lost her mother she used to look at me like I was the greatest man in the world And now she looks at me and it s just disappointment It s too late for me but not for you This is your chance The chance to earn that look in your daughter s eyes to become the hero that she already thinks you are It s not about saving our world it s about saving theirs,104,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Damn that was a good speech,6,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Scott I need you to be the Ant Man,9,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,In the right hands the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic The suit has power the man harnesses that power You need to be skillful agile and above all you need to be fast You should be able to shrink and grow on a dime so your size always suits your needs Now dive through the keyhole Scott You charge big you dive small then you emerge big,69,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Ow Ah Ow,3,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Useless,1,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,When you re small energy is compressed so you have the force of a two hundred pound man behind a fist a hundredth of an inch wide you re like a bullet You punch too hard you kill someone too soft it s a love tap In other words you have to know how to punch,56,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,I was in prison for three years I know how to punch,12,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Show me Terrible,3,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,You want to show me how to punch Show me,10,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,That s how you punch,5,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,She s been looking forward to this,7,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,No kiddin,2,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Hope trained in martial arts at a uh difficult time,10,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Oh by difficult time he means when my mother died,10,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,We lost her in a plane crash,7,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,It s bad enough you won t tell me how she died could you please stop telling me that lie We re working here Alright princess let s get back to work,32,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Were you going for the hand,6,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,You know I think this regulator is holding me back,10,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Do not screw with the regulator If that regulator is compromised you would go sub atomic,16,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,What does that mean,4,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,It means that you would enter a quantum realm,9,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,What does that mean,4,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,It means that you would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space become irrelevant as you shrink for all eternity Everything that you know and love gone forever,31,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Cool Yeah I m if it ain t broke,9,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,You ve learned about the suit but you ve yet to learn about your greatest allies the ants Loyal brave and your partners on this job,26,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Paratrechina longicornis commonly known as crazy ants they re lightning fast and can conduct electricity which makes them useful to fry out enemy electronics,24,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Oh you re not so crazy Hey You re cute Oh Aaah That was a lot scarier a second ago,20,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,It looks like the Futures lab has its own isolated power supply,12,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,There s a security guard posted around the clock we ll need you to take him out to deactivate the security systems,22,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Okay Who s next,4,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Paraponera clavata,2,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,I know Bullet ants right Number one on the Schmidt pain index Hey guys Remember me from the bedroom Whoa,20,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,The Yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed and the only access point is a tube we estimate to be about five millimeters in diameter,23,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Why do I have a sick feeling in my stomach,10,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,The tube is protected by a laser grid and we can only power that down for fifteen seconds,18,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,You re going to need to signal the crazy ants to blow the servers retrieve the suit and exit the vaults before the backup power comes on,27,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Camponotus pennsylvanicus,2,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Alternatively known as a carpenter ant Ideal for ground and air transport,12,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Wait a minute I know this guy I m going to call him Ant thony,15,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,That s good That s very good because this time you re really going to have to learn how to control him Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup,31,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Oh you okay d,4,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Hank wants you outside for target practice,7,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,The suit has no weapons so I made you these discs Red shrinks Blue enlarges,15,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Solenopsis mandibularis,2,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Known for their bite the fire ants have evolved into remarkable architects They are handy to get you in and out of difficult places,24,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,You can do it Scott come on,7,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,They re not listening to me,6,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,You have to commit you have to mean it No shortcuts no lies,13,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Throwing insults into the mix will not do anyone any good Hope,12,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,We don t have time for coddling,7,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Our focus should be on helping Scott,7,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Really Is that where our focus should be,8,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Hope,1,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,I don t know why I came to you in the first place,13,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,We can t do this without her,7,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Oh God,2,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,You gotta lock your doors I mean really There s some weird folks in this neighborhood,16,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Do you think this is a joke Do you have any idea what he s asking you to risk You have a daughter,23,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,I m doing this for her,6,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,You know when my mother died I didn t see him for two weeks,14,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,He was in grief,4,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Yeah so was I and I was seven And he never came back not in any way that counted He just sent me off to boarding school You know I thought with all that s at stake just maybe we might have a chance at making peace But even now he still wants to shut me out,57,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,He doesn t want to shut you out He trusts you,11,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Then why are you here,5,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,It proves that he loves you Hope Look at me I m expendable that s why I m here You must ve realized that by now I mean that s why I m in the suit and you re not He d rather lose than fight than lose you Anyway,50,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,You know I didn t know you had a a daughter when I called the cops on you What s her name,22,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Cassie,1,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,It s a pretty name You have to clear your mind Scott You have to make your thoughts precise that s how it works Think about Cassie about how badly you want to see her and use that to focus Open your eyes and just think about what you want the ants to do That s good,57,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Your mother convinced me to let her join me on my missions They called her the Wasp She was born to it And there s not a day that goes by that I don t regret having said yes It was separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk and launched an ICBM at the United States The only way to the internal mechanics was through solid titanium,69,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,I knew I had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile but my regulator had sustained too much damage Your mother she didn t hesitate,27,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Janet No,2,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,She turned off her regulator and went sub atomic to deactivate the bomb She was gone Your mom died a hero And I spent the next ten years trying to learn all I could about the quantum realm,38,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,You were trying to bring her back,7,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,But all I learned was we know nothing,8,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,It s not your fault She made her choice But why didn t you tell me this sooner,18,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,I was trying to protect you I lost your mother I didn t mean to lose you too,18,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,I m sorry,3,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,This is awesome It s awesome you know You guys are breaking down walls you re healing It s important I ruined the moment didn t I,27,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Yes you did yes,4,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,I m gonna make some tea,6,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Nailed it,2,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,That s a good boy Ant thony,7,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion,11,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,It s freezing You couldn t make a suit with a flannel lining,13,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,We must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy it s a device that I invented from my SHIELD days,20,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,We need it to counteract the transmission blockers that Cross installed in the Futures vault,15,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,It s currently collecting dust in one of Howard Stark s old storage facilities in upstate New York Should be a piece of cake,24,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,You re over the target area Disengage now Scott,9,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Squadron A go B go C go Alright Ant thony please don t drop me this time Ah it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this,29,antman

Sam Wilson / Falcon,You want to tell me what you want,8,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology just for a few days and then return it I need it to save the world You know how that is,31,antman
Sam Wilson / Falcon,I know exactly how that is Located the breach Bringing him in,12,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Sorry about this,3,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,What the hell are you doing,6,antman
Sam Wilson / Falcon,Breach is an adult male who has some sort of shrinking tech,12,antman

Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Sorry You seem like a really great guy,8,antman
Sam Wilson / Falcon,It s really important to me that Cap never finds out about this,13,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,That was completely irresponsible and dangerous You jeopardized everything,9,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,You got it,3,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Well done,2,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Wait a minute Did you just compliment me He did didn t he,13,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Kind of sounded like he did,6,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,I was good wasn t I,6,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Hey how about the fact that I fought an Avenger and didn t die,14,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Now let s not dwell on the past We gotta finish our planning,13,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Don t mind him You did good,7,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Darren How the hell did you get in here,9,antman
Darren Cross / Yellowjacket,You left the front door open Hank It s official You re old,13,antman

Dr. Hank Pym,Well to what do I owe this pleasure,8,antman
Darren Cross / Yellowjacket,I have good news,4,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Really What s that,4,antman
Darren Cross / Yellowjacket,Pym Tech the company you created is about to become one of the most profitable operations in the world We re anticipating fifteen billion in sales tomorrow alone You re welcome I know this is odd but I d like you to be there This is my moment I want you to see it,54,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Sure Darren Yeah sure I ll be there,8,antman
Darren Cross / Yellowjacket,What did you see in me,6,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,I don t know what you mean,7,antman
Darren Cross / Yellowjacket,All those years ago you picked me What did you see,11,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,I saw myself,3,antman
Darren Cross / Yellowjacket,Then why did you push me away,7,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,Because I saw too much of myself,7,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,He knows he s baiting you We have to call it off,12,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,We re all taking risks,5,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,What if he saw me here,6,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,He didn t There s no way,7,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,How do you know that Darren hi,7,antman

Hope van Dyne / Wasp,I m at home why,5,antman
Darren Cross / Yellowjacket,I just saw Hank I still get nothing but contempt from him,12,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Don t let him rile you up he s just he s just a senile old man,17,antman
Darren Cross / Yellowjacket,We need to start everyone working around the clock get the assembly line up and running And I m tripling security Full sensors at all entrances and exterior air vents fitted with steel micro mesh,35,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Great Good idea,3,antman
Darren Cross / Yellowjacket,Thank you Hope I m so lucky to have you on my team,13,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,He s tripling security he s lost his mind and he s on to you,15,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,But he is not on to you,7,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,He s adding full body scanners to all entrances and closing exterior vents How are we gonna get Scott inside,20,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,The water main You can t add security to a water main The pressure is too strong but if we can decrease it that s how I get in,29,antman
Hope van Dyne / Wasp,Somebody would have to reach the building s control center to change the water pressure I mean Hank and I will be beside Cross how are we supposed to do that,31,antman
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,So we expand our team What do we need A fake security guard on the inside to depressurize the water system somebody else to hack into the power supply and kill the laser grid and a getaway guy,38,antman
Dr. Hank Pym,No no No no no Not those three wombats No way,11,antman
Luis,Thank you for the coffee ma am It s not too often that you rob a place and then get welcomed back Because we just robbed you,27,antman

Tony Stark / Iron Man,So there s elements you can,6,avengers_age_of_ultron
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision,The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside Something powerful,13,avengers_age_of_ultron
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Like a reactor,3,avengers_age_of_ultron
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision,Like a computer I believe I m deciphering code,9,avengers_age_of_ultron
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,You sure he s going to be okay Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together,18,avengers_age_of_ultron
Dr. Helen Cho,There s no possibility of deterioration The nano molecular functionality is instantaneous His cells don t know they re bonding with simulacrum,22,avengers_age_of_ultron
Bruce Banner / Hulk,She s creating tissue,4,avengers_age_of_ultron

Tony Stark / Iron Man,Down in Strucker s lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work They deep sixed the data but I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door,29,avengers_age_of_ultron
Bruce Banner / Hulk,Artificial intelligence,2,avengers_age_of_ultron
Tony Stark / Iron Man,This could be it Bruce This could be the key to creating Ultron,13,avengers_age_of_ultron
Bruce Banner / Hulk,I thought Ultron was a fantasy,6,avengers_age_of_ultron

Tony Stark / Iron Man,As a worst case measure right How about a best case What if the world was safe What if next time aliens roll up to the club and they will they couldn t get past the bouncer,37,avengers_age_of_ultron
Bruce Banner / Hulk,The only people threatening the planet would be people,9,avengers_age_of_ultron
Tony Stark / Iron Man,I want to apply this to the Ultron program But JARVIS can t download a data schematic this dense We can only do it while we have the scepter here that s three days give me three days,38,avengers_age_of_ultron
Bruce Banner / Hulk,So you re going for artificial intelligence and you don t want to tell the team,16,avengers_age_of_ultron

Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Only to make conversation,4,avengers_endgame
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Alright So five years ago right before Thanos I was in a place called the Quantum Realm The Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe To get in there you have to be incredibly small Hope she s my She was my She was supposed to pull me out And then Thanos happened and I got stuck in there,60,avengers_endgame
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,I m sorry That must ve been a very long five years,12,avengers_endgame

Steve Rogers / Captain America,Scott what are you talking about,6,avengers_endgame
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,What I m saying is time works differently in the Quantum Realm The only problem is right now we don t have a way to navigate it But what if we did I can t stop thinking about it What if we could somehow control the chaos and we could navigate it What if there was a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time Like Like before Thanos,81,avengers_endgame
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Wait are you talking about a time machine,8,avengers_endgame
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,No No of course not No not a time machine It s more like a Yeah a time machine I know it s crazy But I can t stop thinking about it There s gotta be some way There s gotta be some w it s crazy,47,avengers_endgame

Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,We can snap our own fingers We can bring everyone back,11,avengers_endgame
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Or screw it up worse than he already has right,10,avengers_endgame
Steve Rogers / Captain America,I don t believe we would,6,avengers_endgame
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Gotta say sometimes I miss that giddy optimism However high hopes won t help if there s no logical tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise,40,avengers_endgame
Scott Lang / Ant-Man,Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel That means no talking to our past selves no betting on sporting events,23,avengers_endgame
Tony Stark / Iron Man,I m gonna stop you right there Scott Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future,27,avengers_endgame

Bruce Banner / Hulk,Please please,2,avengers_endgame
The Ancient One,I m sorry I can t help you Bruce If I give up the Time Stone to help your Reality I m dooming my own,25,avengers_endgame
Bruce Banner / Hulk,With all due respect I m not sure the science really supports that,13,avengers_endgame
The Ancient One,The Infinity Stones create what you experience as the flow of time Remove one stone and that flow splits Now this may benefit your reality but my new one not so much In this new branched Reality without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness our world will be overrun Millions will suffer So tell me Doctor can your science prevent all that,64,avengers_endgame
Bruce Banner / Hulk,No but we can erase it Because once we are done with the stones we can return each one to its own timeline at the moment it was taken So chronologically in that reality it never left,37,avengers_endgame
The Ancient One,But you are leaving out the most important part In order to return the stones you have to survive,19,avengers_endgame
Bruce Banner / Hulk,We will I will I promise,6,avengers_endgame
The Ancient One,I can t risk this Reality on a promise It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone,22,avengers_endgame
Bruce Banner / Hulk,Then why the hell did Strange give it away,9,avengers_endgame
The Ancient One,What did you say,4,avengers_endgame
Bruce Banner / Hulk,Strange he gave it away He gave it to Thanos,10,avengers_endgame
The Ancient One,Willingly,1,avengers_endgame
Bruce Banner / Hulk,Yes,1,avengers_endgame
The Ancient One,Why,1,avengers_endgame
Bruce Banner / Hulk,I have no idea Maybe he made a mistake,9,avengers_endgame
The Ancient One,Or I did Strange is meant to be the best of us,12,avengers_endgame
Bruce Banner / Hulk,So he must have done it for a reason,9,avengers_endgame
The Ancient One,I fear you might be right,6,avengers_endgame
Bruce Banner / Hulk,Thank you,2,avengers_endgame
The Ancient One,I m counting on you Bruce We all are,9,avengers_endgame

Drax the Destroyer,Including my own,3,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,If he gets all six Infinity Stones he can do it with the snap of his fingers like this,19,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,You seem to know a great deal about Thanos,9,avengers_infinity_war
Drax the Destroyer,Gamora is the daughter of Thanos,6,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Your father killed my brother,5,avengers_infinity_war
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Oh boy Stepfather Technically she hates him as much as you do,12,avengers_infinity_war

Peter Quill / Star-Lord,And I feel your pain as well I mean it s not a competition but I ve been through a lot My father killed my mother then I had to kill my father And that was hard Probably even harder than having to kill a sister Plus I came out of it with both of my eyes,57,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,I need a hammer not a spoon He attempts to fiddle with machinery How do I open this thing Is there some sort of a four digit code maybe maybe a birth date or something,35,avengers_infinity_war

Peter Quill / Star-Lord,No Knowhere It s a place We ve been there It sucks Excuse me that s our food,18,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Not anymore,2,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Thor why would he go to Knowhere,7,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Because for years the Reality Stone has been safely stored there with a man we call the Collector,18,avengers_infinity_war
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,If it s with the Collector then it s not safe Only an idiot would give that man a stone,20,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Or a genius,3,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,How do you know he s not going for one of the other Stones,14,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,There s six stones out there Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week when he decimated Xandar He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth They re with the Avengers,53,avengers_infinity_war
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,The Avengers,2,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Earth s Mightiest Heroes,4,avengers_infinity_war
Mantis,Like Kevin Bacon,3,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,He may be on the team I don t know Haven t been there in a while As for the Soul Stone well no one s ever seen that No one even knows where it is Therefore Thanos can t get it Therefore he s going to Knowhere Hence he ll be getting the Reality Stone You re welcome,59,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Then we have to go to Knowhere now,8,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Wrong Where we have to go is Nivadellir,8,avengers_infinity_war
Drax the Destroyer,That s a made up word,6,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,All words are made up,5,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket,Hold up Nidavellir is real Seriously I mean that place is a legend They make the most powerful horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe I would very much like to go there please,34,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,The rabbit is correct and clearly the smartest among you,10,avengers_infinity_war

Thor,No You simply lack the strength to wield them Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness,20,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket,Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now,11,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,A little bit Yeah,4,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,If we don t go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone he ll be too powerful to stop,19,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,He already is,3,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket,I got it figured out We got two ships and a large assortment of morons So me and Groot will go with the pirate angel here and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos Cool Cool,40,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,So cool,2,avengers_infinity_war
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,For the record I know that you re only going with him because it s where Thanos isn t,19,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket,You know you shouldn t talk that way to your captain Quill Come on Groot Put that game down you ll rot your brain,24,avengers_infinity_war

James Rhodes / War Machine,You know they re only criminals because you ve chosen to call them that right sir,16,avengers_infinity_war
Thaddeus Ross,My God Rhodes your talent for horseshit rivals my own,10,avengers_infinity_war

James Rhodes / War Machine,Not anymore,2,avengers_infinity_war
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Mr Secretary,2,avengers_infinity_war
Thaddeus Ross,You got some nerve I ll give you that,9,avengers_infinity_war
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,You could use some of that right now,8,avengers_infinity_war
Thaddeus Ross,The world s on fire And you think all is forgiven,11,avengers_infinity_war
Steve Rogers / Captain America,I m not looking for forgiveness And I m way past asking for permission Earth just lost her best defender So we re here to fight And if you wanna stand in our way we ll fight you too,39,avengers_infinity_war

Bruce Banner / Hulk,We need all hands on deck Where s Clint,9,avengers_infinity_war

Bruce Banner / Hulk,There s an Ant Man and a Spider Man Okay look Thanos has the biggest army in the universe And he is not gonna stop until he he gets Vision s Stone,32,avengers_infinity_war
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Well then we have to protect it,7,avengers_infinity_war
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision,No we have to destroy it I ve been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head about its nature But also its composition I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source something very similar to its own signature perhaps its molecular integrity could fail,53,avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,And you with it We re not having this conversation,10,avengers_infinity_war
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision,Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can t get it,16,avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,That s too high a price,6,avengers_infinity_war
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision,Only you have the power to pay it Thanos threatens half the Universe One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him,23,avengers_infinity_war
Steve Rogers / Captain America,But it should We don t trade lives Vision,9,avengers_infinity_war
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision,Captain years ago you laid down your life to save how many millions of people Tell me why is this any different,22,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner / Hulk,Because you might have a choice Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays J A R V I S Ultron Tony me the Stone All of them mixed together All of them learning from one another,40,avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,You re saying Vision isn t just the stone,9,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner / Hulk,I m saying that if we take out the stone there s still a whole lot of Vision left Perhaps the best parts,23,avengers_infinity_war
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Can we do that,4,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner / Hulk,Not me Not here,4,avengers_infinity_war

Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier,Where s the fight,4,avengers_infinity_war
T'Challa / Black Panther,On its way,3,avengers_infinity_war
Ebony Maw,In all the time I ve served Thanos I ve never failed him If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person there would be judgement Give me the stone,41,avengers_infinity_war

Tony Stark / Iron Man,And now I gotta hear it,6,avengers_infinity_war
Peter Parker / Spider-Man,And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship And this suit is ridiculously intuitive by the way So if anything it s kinda your fault that I m here,31,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark / Iron Man,God damnit,2,avengers_infinity_war

Ebony Maw,Painful aren t they They were originally designed for microsurgery And any one of them,15,avengers_infinity_war
Ebony Maw,Could end your friend s life in an instant,9,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark / Iron Man,I gotta tell you he s not really my friend Saving his life is more a professional courtesy,18,avengers_infinity_war
Ebony Maw,You ve saved nothing Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine,11,avengers_infinity_war

Tony Stark / Iron Man,No It s you who doesn t understand that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he s back And I don t know what to do So I m not so sure if it s a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did what they can do At least on his turf he s not expecting it So I say we take the fight to him Doctor Do you concur,92,avengers_infinity_war
Dr. Stephen Strange,Alright Stark We go to him But you have to understand if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone I will not hesitate to let either of you die I can t because the fate of the universe depends on it,46,avengers_infinity_war

Thanos,I saved you,3,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,No No We were happy on my home planet,9,avengers_infinity_war
Thanos,Going to bed hungry scrounging for scraps Your planet was on the brink of collapse I m the one who stopped that Do you know what s happened since then The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies It s a paradise,46,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Because you murdered half the planet,6,avengers_infinity_war
Thanos,A small price to pay for salvation,7,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,You re insane,3,avengers_infinity_war
Thanos,Little one it s a simple calculus This universe is finite its resources finite If life is left unchecked life will cease to exist It needs correction,27,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,YOU DON T KNOW THAT,5,avengers_infinity_war
Thanos,I m the only one who knows that At least I m the only one with the will to act on it For a time you had that same will as you fought by my side Daughter,37,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,I m not your daughter Everything I hate about myself you taught me,13,avengers_infinity_war
Thanos,And in doing so made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy That s why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone,23,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,I m sorry I disappointed you,6,avengers_infinity_war

Rocket,Better be some hammer,4,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,You know I m years old I ve killed twice as many enemies as that and every one would have rather killed me but none succeeded I m only alive because fate wants me alive Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance Fate wills it so,59,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket,And what if you re wrong,6,avengers_infinity_war

Sam Wilson / Falcon,How long are you going to play both sides,9,captain_america_civil_war
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision,I have an equation,4,captain_america_civil_war
Sam Wilson / Falcon,Oh this will clear it up,6,captain_america_civil_war
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision,In the eight years since Mr Stark announced himself as Iron Man the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially And during the same period the number of potentially world ending events has risen at a commensurate rate,39,captain_america_civil_war
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Are you saying it s our fault,7,captain_america_civil_war
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision,I m saying there may be a causality Our very strength invites challenge Challenge incites conflict And conflict breeds catastrophe Oversight oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand,33,captain_america_civil_war
James Rhodes / War Machine,Boom,1,captain_america_civil_war

Tony Stark / Iron Man,Oh that s Charles Spencer by the way He s a great kid Computer engineering degree GPA Had a floor level gig at Intel planned for the fall But first he wanted to put a few miles on his soul before he parked it behind a desk See the world Maybe be of service Charlie didn t want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale which is what I would do He didn t go to Paris or Amsterdam which sounds fun He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor Guess where Sokovia,97,captain_america_civil_war
Tony Stark / Iron Man,He wanted to make a difference I suppose I mean we won t know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass,26,captain_america_civil_war
Tony Stark / Iron Man,There s no decision making process here We need to be put in check Whatever form that takes I m game If we can t accept limitations if we re boundary less we re no better than the bad guys,40,captain_america_civil_war
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Tony someone dies on your watch you don t give up,11,captain_america_civil_war

James Rhodes / War Machine,I m sorry Steve That that is dangerously arrogant This is the United Nations we re talking about It s not the World Security Council it s not SHIELD it s not HYDRA,33,captain_america_civil_war

Tony Stark / Iron Man,That s good That s why I m here When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands I shut it down and stop manufacturing,29,captain_america_civil_war
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Tony you chose to do that If we sign this we surrender our right to choose What if this panel sends us somewhere we don t think we should go What if there is somewhere we need to go and they don t let us We may not be perfect but the safest hands are still our own,58,captain_america_civil_war
Tony Stark / Iron Man,If we don t do this now it s gonna be done to us later That s the fact That won t be pretty,24,captain_america_civil_war
Wanda Maximoff,You re saying they ll come for me,8,captain_america_civil_war

Sharon Carter,She had a photograph in her office Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK As a kid that was pretty cool But it was a lot to live up to Which is why I never told anyone we were related,39,captain_america_civil_war
Sharon Carter,I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either And she said compromise where you can But where you can t don t Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right Even if the whole world is telling you to move it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree look them in they eye and say No you move,82,captain_america_civil_war
Steve Rogers / Captain America,When I came out of the ice I thought everyone I had known was gone Then I found out that she was alive I was just lucky to have her,30,captain_america_civil_war

Dr. Abraham Erskine,Me too,2,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Can I ask you a question,6,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Abraham Erskine,Just one,2,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Why me,2,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Abraham Erskine,I suppose that is the only question that matters This is from Augsburg My city So many people forget that the first country that the Nazi s invaded was their own You know after the last war the my people struggled They they felt weak They felt small And then Hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and the and the And he he hears of me my work and he finds me And he says You He says You will make us strong Well I am not interested So he sends the head of HYDRA his research division A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt Now Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he s ambitious He and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers But for Schmidt it is not fantasy For him it is real He has become convinced that there is a great power hidden in the earth left here by the Gods waiting to be seized by a superior man So when he hears about my formula and what it can do he cannot resist,201,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Abraham Erskine,Schmidt must become that superior man,6,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Did it make him stronger,5,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Abraham Erskine,Yeah But there were other effects The serum was not ready But more important the man The serum amplifies everything that is inside So good becomes great Bad becomes worse This is why you were chosen Because a strong man who has known power all his life will lose respect for that power But a weak man knows the value of strength and knows compassion,65,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Thanks I think,3,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Abraham Erskine,Whatever happens tomorrow you must promise me one thing That you will stay who you are Not a perfect soldier but a good man,24,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,To the little guys,4,captain_america_first_avenger

Dr. Arnim Zola,I understand you found him,5,captain_america_first_avenger
Johann Schmidt / Red Skull,See for yourself You disapprove,5,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Arnim Zola,I just don t see why you need concern yourself I can t imagine he will succeed Again,18,captain_america_first_avenger
Johann Schmidt / Red Skull,His serum is the Allies only defence against this power we now possess If we take it away from them then our victory is assured,25,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Arnim Zola,Shall I give the order,5,captain_america_first_avenger
Johann Schmidt / Red Skull,It has been given,4,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Arnim Zola,Good,1,captain_america_first_avenger

Johann Schmidt / Red Skull,Reward Call it what it is Exile I no longer reflect his image of Aryan perfection,16,captain_america_first_avenger
Roeder,You think this is about appearances Your HYDRA division has failed to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year And we had learned through local intelligence you had mounted a full scale incursion into Norway,38,captain_america_first_avenger
Schneider,The F hrer feels How does he put it The Red Skull has been indulged long enough,17,captain_america_first_avenger
Johann Schmidt / Red Skull,Gentlemen you have come to see the results of our work Let me show you Hitler speaks of a thousand year Reich but he cannot feed his army for a month His troops spill their blood across every field in Europe But still he is no closer to achieving his goals,51,captain_america_first_avenger
Roeder,And I suppose you still aim to end this war through magic,12,captain_america_first_avenger
Johann Schmidt / Red Skull,Science But I understand your confusion Great power has always baffled primitive men HYDRA is assembling an arsenal to destroy my enemies in one stroke Where ever they are regardless of how many forces they possess All in a matter of hours,42,captain_america_first_avenger

Steve Rogers / Captain America,Excuse me I m looking for Mr Stark,8,captain_america_first_avenger
Pvt. Lorraine,He s in with Colonel Phillips Of course you re welcome to wait I read about what you did,19,captain_america_first_avenger

Howard Stark,Fondue is just cheese and bread my friend,8,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Really I didn t think,5,captain_america_first_avenger
Howard Stark,Nor should you pal The moment you think you know what s goin on in a woman s head it s the moment your goose is well and truly cooked Me I concentrate on work Which at the moment is about making sure you and your men do not get killed Carbon polymer Should withstand your average German bayonet Although Hydra s not going to attack you with a pocket knife I hear you re uh kinda attached,78,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,It s handier than you might think,7,captain_america_first_avenger

Howard Stark,No No That s just a prototype,7,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,What s it made of,5,captain_america_first_avenger
Howard Stark,Vibranium It s stronger than steel and a third of the weight It s completely vibration absorbent,17,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,How come it s not a standard issue,8,captain_america_first_avenger
Howard Stark,That s the rarest metal on earth What you re holding there That s all we ve got,18,captain_america_first_avenger
Peggy Carter,You quite finished Mr Stark I m sure the Captain has some unfinished business,14,captain_america_first_avenger

Peggy Carter,Yes I think it works,5,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,I had some ideas about the uniform,7,captain_america_first_avenger
Howard Stark,Whatever you want pal,4,captain_america_first_avenger
Johann Schmidt / Red Skull,You are failing We are close to an offensive network that will shake the planet And yet we are continually delayed because you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield,30,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Arnim Zola,This is hardly my area of expertise I I merely develop the weapons I I cannot fire them,18,captain_america_first_avenger
Johann Schmidt / Red Skull,Finish your mission Doctor Before the American finishes his,9,captain_america_first_avenger
Guard,Sir,1,captain_america_first_avenger
Facility Manager,I m sorry Herr Schmidt We fought to the last man,11,captain_america_first_avenger

Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier,This isn t payback is it,6,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Now why would I do that,6,captain_america_first_avenger
Gabe Jones,We were right Dr Zola s on the train Hydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle Wherever he s going they must need him bad,28,captain_america_first_avenger
James Montgomery Falsworth,Let s get going because they re moving like the devil,11,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,We only got about a second window You miss that window we re bugs on a windshield,17,captain_america_first_avenger

Colonel Chester Phillips,Cow Doctor do you realize how difficult it is to get ahold of a prime cut like that out here,20,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Arnim Zola,I don t eat meat,5,captain_america_first_avenger
Colonel Chester Phillips,Why not,2,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Arnim Zola,It disagrees with me,4,captain_america_first_avenger
Colonel Chester Phillips,How about cyanide Does that give you the rumbly tummy too Every Hydra agent that we ve tried to take alive has crunched a little pill before we can stop him But not you So here s my brilliant theory You wanna live,43,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Arnim Zola,You re trying to intimidate me Colonel,7,captain_america_first_avenger
Colonel Chester Phillips,I bought you dinner,4,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Arnim Zola,Given the variable information he has provided and in exchange for his full cooperation Dr Zola is being remanded to Switzerland,21,captain_america_first_avenger
Colonel Chester Phillips,I sent that message to Washington this morning Of course it was encoded You guys haven t broken those codes have you That would be awkward,26,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Arnim Zola,Schmidt will know this is a lie,7,captain_america_first_avenger
Colonel Chester Phillips,He s gonna kill you anyway Doc You re a liability You know more about Schmidt than anyone And the last guy you cost us was Captain Rogers closest friend So I wouldn t count on the very best of protection There s you or Schmidt It s just the hand you ve been dealt,55,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Arnim Zola,Schmidt believes he walks in the foot steps of the Gods,11,captain_america_first_avenger
Colonel Chester Phillips,Mmm,1,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Arnim Zola,Only the world itself will satisfy him,7,captain_america_first_avenger
Colonel Chester Phillips,You do realize that s nuts don t you,9,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Arnim Zola,But the sanity of the plan is of no consequence,10,captain_america_first_avenger
Colonel Chester Phillips,And why is that,4,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Arnim Zola,Because he can do it,5,captain_america_first_avenger
Colonel Chester Phillips,What s his target,4,captain_america_first_avenger
Dr. Arnim Zola,His target is everywhere,4,captain_america_first_avenger
Johann Schmidt / Red Skull,Tomorrow Hydra will stand master of the world Born to victory on the wings of the Valkyrie Our enemies weapons will be powerless against us If they shoot down one plane hundreds more will rain fire upon them If they cut off one head two more shall take its place Hail Hydra,52,captain_america_first_avenger
Man on the Radio,Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area Please wait for the all clear Your attention please All citizens shall remain indoors until further notice Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area,35,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Dr Erskine said that the serum wouldn t just effect my muscles it would effect my cells Create a protective system of regeneration and healing Which means um I can t get drunk Did you know that,37,captain_america_first_avenger
Peggy Carter,Your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person He thought it could be one of the side effects It wasn t your fault,25,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Did you read the reports,5,captain_america_first_avenger
Peggy Carter,Yes,1,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Then you know that s not true,7,captain_america_first_avenger

Steve Rogers / Captain America,I m goin after Schmidt I m not gonna stop till all of Hydra is dead or captured,18,captain_america_first_avenger
Peggy Carter,You won t be alone,5,captain_america_first_avenger
Colonel Chester Phillips,Johann Schmidt belongs in a bug house He thinks he s a God He s willing to blow up half the world to prove it starting with the USA,29,captain_america_first_avenger
Howard Stark,Schmidt s working with powers beyond our capabilities He gets across the Atlantic he will wipe out the entire eastern sea board in an hour,25,captain_america_first_avenger
Gabe Jones,How much time we got,5,captain_america_first_avenger

Steve Rogers / Captain America,Why not That s exactly what we re gonna do,10,captain_america_first_avenger
Johann Schmidt / Red Skull,Arrogance may not be a uniquely American trait but I must say you do it better than anyone But there are limits to what even you can do Captain Or did Erskine tell you otherwise,35,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,He told me you were insane,6,captain_america_first_avenger
Johann Schmidt / Red Skull,Ah He resented my genius and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine But he gave you everything So what made you so special,25,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Nothin I m just a kid from Brooklyn I can do this all day,14,captain_america_first_avenger

Steve Rogers / Captain America,Yeah give me a second,5,captain_america_winter_soldier
Brock Rumlow,They want you now,4,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Okay,1,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,You re a terrible liar,5,captain_america_winter_soldier
Jasper Sitwell,STRIKE team escort Captain Rogers back to SHIELD immediately for questioning,11,captain_america_winter_soldier
Brock Rumlow,I told him,3,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Let s go,3,captain_america_winter_soldier
Brock Rumlow,Yeah STRIKE move it out,5,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,For whatever it s worth you did your best,9,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sharon Carter,Thank you sir Captain Rogers,5,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Neighbor,1,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,Ah Captain I m Alexander Pierce,6,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Sir it s an honor,5,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,The honor is mine Captain My father served in the st Come on in That photo was taken five years after Nick and I met When I was at State Department in Bogota ELN rebels took the embassy and security got me out but the rebels took hostages Nick was deputy chief for the SHIELD station there And he comes to me with a plan He wants to storm the building through the sewers I said No we ll negotiate Turned out the ELN didn t negotiate so they put out a kill order They stormed the basement and what did they find They find it empty Nick had ignored my direct order and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil He saved the lives of a dozen political officers including my daughter,135,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,So you gave him a promotion,6,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,I ve never had any cause to regret it Captain why was Nick in your apartment last night,18,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,I don t know,4,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,You know it was bugged,5,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,I did because Nick told me,6,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,Did he tell you he was the one who bugged it I want you to see something,17,captain_america_winter_soldier
SHIELD Agent,Who hired you Batroc,4,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Is that live,3,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,Yeah they picked him up last night in a not so safe house in Algiers,15,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Are you saying he s a suspect Assassination isn t Batroc s line,13,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,No it s more complicated than that Batroc was hired anonymously to attack the Lemurian Star and he was contacted by e mail and paid by wire transfer And then the money was run through seventeen fictitious accounts the last one going to a holding company that was registered to a Jacob Veech,53,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Am I supposed to know who that is,8,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,Not likely Veech died six years ago His last address was Elmhurst Drive When I first met Nick his mother lived at,22,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Are you saying Fury hired the pirates Why,8,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,The prevailing theory was that the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence The sale went sour and that led to Nick s death,29,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,If you really knew Nick Fury you d know that s not true,13,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,Why do you think we re talking See I took a seat on the Council not because I wanted to but because Nick asked me to because we were both realists We knew that despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric that to build a really better world sometimes means having to tear the old one down And that makes enemies Those people that call you dirty because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better And the idea that those people could be happy today makes me really really angry Captain you were the last one to see Nick alive I don t think that s an accident and I don t think you do either So I m gonna ask again why was he there,139,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,He told me not to trust anyone,7,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,I wonder if that included him,6,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,I m sorry Those were his last words Excuse me,10,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,Captain Somebody murdered my friend and I m gonna find out why Anyone gets in my way they re gonna regret it Anyone,23,captain_america_winter_soldier

Sharon Carter,With all due respect If SHIELD is conducting a manhunt for Captain America we deserve to know why,18,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,Because he lied to us Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury he refused to share it As difficult as this is to accept Captain America is a fugitive from SHIELD,34,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Where is it,3,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Safe,1,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Do better,2,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Where did you get it,5,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Why would I tell you,5,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Fury gave it to you Why,6,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,What s on it,4,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,I don t know,4,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Stop lying,2,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,I only act like I know everything Rogers,8,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates didn t you,11,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Well it makes sense The ship was dirty Fury needed a way in so do you,16,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,I m not gonna ask you again,7,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,I know who killed Fury Most of the intelligence community doesn t believe he exists the ones who do call him the Winter Soldier He s credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last fifty years,37,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,So he s a ghost story,6,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Five years ago I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran somebody shot out my tires near Odessa We lost control went straight over a cliff I pulled us out but the Winter Soldier was there I was covering my engineer so he shot him straight through me Soviet slug no rifling Bye bye bikinis,56,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Yeah I bet you look terrible in them now,9,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Going after him is a dead end I know I ve tried Like you said he s a ghost story,20,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Well let s find out what the ghost wants,9,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood To any reasonable person that would make him a martyr not a traitor,20,captain_america_winter_soldier
Councilman Rockwell,You know what makes him a traitor Hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship,15,captain_america_winter_soldier
Councilman Singh,Nick Fury used your friendship to coerce this council into delaying Project Insight A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations At best he lied to you At worst,31,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,Are you calling for my resignation I ve got a pen and paper right here,15,captain_america_winter_soldier
Councilwoman Hawley,That discussion can be tabled for a later time,9,captain_america_winter_soldier
Alexander Pierce,But you do want to have a discussion,8,captain_america_winter_soldier
Councilman Rockwell,We ve already had it Mr Secretary This council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight If you want to say something snappy now would be a good time,28,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,First rule of going on the run is don t run walk,12,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,If I run in these shoes they re gonna fall off,11,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,The drive has a Level Six homing program so as soon as we boot up SHIELD will know exactly where we are,22,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,How much time do we have,6,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Uh about nine minutes from Now Fury was right about that ship somebody s trying to hide something This drive is protected by some sort of AI it keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands,35,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Can you override it,4,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me Slightly I m gonna try running a tracer This is a program that SHIELD developed to track hostile malware so if we can t read the file maybe we can find out where it came from,46,captain_america_winter_soldier
Apple Employee,Can I help you guys with anything,7,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Oh no My fianc was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations,12,captain_america_winter_soldier

Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,You still uncomfortable,3,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,It s not exactly the word I would use,9,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car,10,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Nazi Germany,2,captain_america_winter_soldier

Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Everybody needs practice,3,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,It was not my first kiss since I m ninety five I m not dead,15,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Nobody special though,3,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Believe it or not it s kind of hard to find someone with shared life experience,16,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Well that s alright you just make something up,9,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,What like you,3,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,I don t know The truth is a matter of circumstances it s not all things to all people all the time And neither am I,26,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,That s a tough way to live,7,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,It s a good way not to die though,9,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,You know it s kind of hard to trust someone when you don t know who that someone really is,20,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Yeah Who do you want me to be,8,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,How about a friend,4,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Well there s a chance you might be in the wrong business Rogers,13,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,This is it,3,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,The file came from these coordinates,6,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,So did I This camp is where I was trained,10,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Changed much,2,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,A little,2,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sergeant Duffy,Pick up the pace ladies Let s go Let s go Double time Come on Rogers move it Come on Fall in Rogers I said fall in,27,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,This is a dead end Zero heat signature zero waves not even radio Whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off What is it,29,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Army regulations forbid storing ammunition within five hundred yards of the barracks This building is in the wrong place,19,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,This is SHIELD,3,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Maybe where it started,4,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,There s Stark s father,5,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Howard,1,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Who s the girl,4,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,If you re already working in a secret office Why do you need to hide the elevator,17,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,This can t be the data point this technology is ancient,11,captain_america_winter_soldier
Computer,Initiate system,2,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Y E S spells yes Shall we play a game It s from a movie that,16,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Yeah I saw it,4,captain_america_winter_soldier
Dr. Arnim Zola,Rogers Steven Born Romanoff Natalia Alianovna Born,7,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,It s some kind of a recording,7,captain_america_winter_soldier
Dr. Arnim Zola,I am not a recording Fr ulein I may not be the man I was when the Captain took me prisoner in but I am,25,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Do you know this thing,5,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull He s been dead for years,18,captain_america_winter_soldier
Dr. Arnim Zola,First correction I am Swiss Second look around you I have never been more alive In I received a terminal diagnosis Science could not save my body my mind however that was worth saving on two hundred thousand feet of data banks You are standing in my brain,48,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,How did you get here,5,captain_america_winter_soldier
Dr. Arnim Zola,Invited,1,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,It was Operation Paperclip after World War II SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic value,15,captain_america_winter_soldier
Dr. Arnim Zola,They thought I could help their cause I also helped my own,12,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,HYDRA died with the Red Skull,6,captain_america_winter_soldier
Dr. Arnim Zola,Cut off one head two more shall take its place,10,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Prove it,2,captain_america_winter_soldier
Dr. Arnim Zola,Accessing archive HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom What we did not realize was that if you try to take that freedom they resist The war taught us much Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly After the war SHIELD was founded and I was recruited The new HYDRA grew A beautiful parasite inside SHIELD For seventy years HYDRA has been secretly feeding crisis reaping war And when history did not cooperate history was changed,85,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,That s impossible SHIELD would have stopped you,8,captain_america_winter_soldier
Dr. Arnim Zola,Accidents will happen HYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security Once the purification process is complete HYDRA s new world order will arise We won Captain Your death amounts to the same as your Life a zero sum As I was saying,54,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,What s on this drive,5,captain_america_winter_soldier
Dr. Arnim Zola,Project Insight requires insight So I wrote an algorithm,9,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,What kind of algorithm What does it do,8,captain_america_winter_soldier
Dr. Arnim Zola,The answer to your question is fascinating Unfortunately you shall be too dead to hear it,16,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Steve we got a bogey Short range ballistic seconds tops,10,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Who fired it,3,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,S H I E L D,6,captain_america_winter_soldier
Dr. Arnim Zola,I am afraid I have been stalling Captain Admit it it s better this way We re both of us out of time,23,captain_america_winter_soldier
Brock Rumlow,Call in the asset,4,captain_america_winter_soldier
Renata,I m going to go Mr Pierce You need anything before I leave,13,captain_america_winter_soldier

Sam Wilson / Falcon,Hey man,2,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,I m sorry about this We need a place to lay low,12,captain_america_winter_soldier

Sam Wilson / Falcon,Not everyone,2,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,You okay,2,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Yeah,1,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,What s going on,4,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,When I first joined SHIELD I thought I was going straight But I guess I just traded in the KGB for HYDRA I thought I knew whose lies I was telling but I guess I can t tell the difference anymore,41,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,There s a chance you might be in the wrong business,11,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,I owe you,3,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,It s okay,3,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,If it was the other way around and it was down to me to save your life and you be honest with me would you trust me to do it,30,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,I would now And I m always honest,8,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Well you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing,15,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Well I guess I just like to know who I m fighting,12,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson / Falcon,I made breakfast If you guys eat that sort of thing,11,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,So the question is who in SHIELD could launch a domestic missile strike,13,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Pierce,1,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Who happens to be sitting on top of the most secure building in the world,15,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,But he s not working alone Zola s algorithm was on the Lemurian Star,14,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,So was Jasper Sitwell,4,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,So the real question is how do the two most wanted people in Washington kidnap a SHIELD officer in broad daylight,21,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson / Falcon,The answer is you don t,6,captain_america_winter_soldier

Sam Wilson / Falcon,Yeah,1,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,I heard they couldn t bring in the choppers because of the RPGs What did you use a stealth chute,20,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson / Falcon,No These,2,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,I thought you said you were a pilot,8,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson / Falcon,I never said pilot,4,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,I can t ask you to do this Sam You got out for a good reason,16,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson / Falcon,Dude Captain America needs my help There s no better reason to get back in,15,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Where can we get our hands on one of these things,11,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson / Falcon,The last one is at Fort Meade behind three guarded gates and a twelve inch steel wall,17,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Shouldn t be a problem,5,captain_america_winter_soldier
Senator Stern,Listen I gotta fly home tonight cause uh I got some constituency problem and I gotta press the flesh,19,captain_america_winter_soldier
Jasper Sitwell,Any constituent in particular Mr Senator,6,captain_america_winter_soldier

Nick Fury,We need to breach those carriers and replace their targeting blades with our own,14,captain_america_winter_soldier
Agent Maria Hill,One or two won t cut it We need to link all three carriers for this to work because if even one of those ships remains operational a whole lot of people are gonna die,35,captain_america_winter_soldier

Nick Fury,You sat there and watched me play with tape When all you had to do was,16,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,I didn t want to steal your thunder,8,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Huh Lawson,2,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Ha Lawson s plan for the light speed engine I wonder why they terminated the project,16,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Um maybe because she s cuckoo,6,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Kree glyphs,2,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Hmm,1,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Lawson is not cuckoo She s Kree,7,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Well she s dead,4,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,What,1,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,She crashed the ASIS aircraft during an unauthorized test flight Took a pilot down with her That s why security here s so unfriendly They re covering up a billion dollar mistake Oh and your light speed engine is toast,40,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,When did this crash happen,5,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Six years ago,3,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Who was the pilot,4,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Um most of this thing s redacted but there is a testimonial here from a Maria Rambeau Last person to see them both alive,24,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,You OK,2,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Mm hmm,2,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Back in a minute,4,captain_marvel
Lawson,This isn t about fighting wars It s about ending them,11,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,I know Lawson was Kree She was here on C and died in a plane crash Do you know anything about this,22,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,I just discovered a mission report sent from C There s only so much I m cleared to tell you Vers but Lawson was an undercover Kree operative named Mar Vell She was working on a unique energy core Experimenting with tech that apparently could help us win the war,50,captain_marvel
Director,Still here,2,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,She s co operating with the investigation sir,8,captain_marvel
Director,You men stay here,4,captain_marvel
Director,I want to question her alone Excellent work Nicholas,9,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Does it say anything about me,6,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,Anything about you No of course not Why would it,10,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,I found evidence that I had a life here,9,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,On C,2,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Mar Vell is who I see in the Supreme Intelligence I knew her And I knew her as Lawson,19,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,This sounds like Skrull simulation Vers,6,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,No its not Cause I remember I was here,9,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,Stop Remember your training Know your enemy It could be you Do not let your emotions undermine your judgment,19,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,She s on sub level I ll get off on take the stairs in case she runs for it Do a pincer move like we did in Havana,28,captain_marvel
Director,Right Like we did in Havana,6,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,We re nearing the jump point Leave your beacon on so I can find you We ll get to the bottom of this Vers Together,25,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Ok,1,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Vers Vers,2,captain_marvel
Agent,Fury s colluding with the target,6,captain_marvel
Agent Phil Coulson,Then why did he call us in,7,captain_marvel
Agent,All I know is that we take him in too Dead or alive,13,captain_marvel
Agent Phil Coulson,Dead or alive,3,captain_marvel
Director,Is it something I said,5,captain_marvel
Director,Now you know I don t really need these to see holding up his glasses which were knocked off during the fight But they do kinda complete the look the Director s voice suddenly changes into the voice of Skrull General Talos Don t you think,46,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,You called them in,4,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,My bad,2,captain_marvel
Agent,Coulson you have eyes on them,6,captain_marvel
Agent Phil Coulson,They re not down here Let s try up there,10,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,What,1,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Your communicator You obviously can t be trusted with it,10,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Do you know how to fly this thing,8,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Uh we ll see,4,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,That s a yes or no question,7,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Yes,1,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,That s what I m talking about,7,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,We ve got a stowaway,5,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Hang on Goose,3,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Who s a good kitty huh Huh Goose Yes that s right Who s a good kitty Goose You re a good kitty,23,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,See anyone you know Funny story I arrived on Hala near dead no memory That was six years ago,19,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,So you think you re the pilot that went down with Dr Lawson,13,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,I m saying that the last person to see them alive can probably tell us,15,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Maria Rambeau,2,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Mmhmm So how do we get to Louisianna,8,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Due East Hang a right at Memphis,7,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,That agent that stopped the Skrulls from fighting us,9,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Coulson New guy Guess he doesn t hate me yet,10,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Yeah well give him time,5,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,I guess he had a feeling went with his gut against orders It s a really hard thing to do That s what keeps us human,26,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,I get in trouble for that A lot,8,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,I see that about you Vers and Fury laugh about this Rescuing the guy how sold you out to the Skrulls I guess that s not standard Kree operating procedure,30,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Well I won t tell your boss if you don t tell mine,13,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,Ronan,1,captain_marvel
Ronan,The Accusors have completed their operation but the greater mission was a failure thanks to your team,17,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,It was a trap To lure our operative Vers to talk for her kidnapper,14,captain_marvel
Ronan,Give us the location we ll take care of the terrorist threat,12,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,By bombing them out of the galaxy No We ll handle this,12,captain_marvel
Ronan,Several Skrulls anywhere is a threat to Kree everywhere Where are they,12,captain_marvel
Korath,They are,2,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,Lost They are lost for now But we will find them,11,captain_marvel
Ronan,Do so or we will,5,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,Maintain the course for C,5,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Excuse me I m looking for Maria Rambeau,8,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,Aunty Carol Mom it s Aunty Carol I knew it everybody said you were dead but we knew they were lying,21,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,I m not really who you think I am,9,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,That is the craziest shit I have ever heard,9,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,Green transforming aliens There s no such thing,8,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,You re absolutely right young lady There is no such thing Cause if there were we would want to keep that to ourselves Fury looks towards Vers accusingly,28,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,You don t believe me,5,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,No way That s so cool,6,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Oh ho She can do a lot more than just make tea with those hands,15,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,Like what Show us,4,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Maybe later,2,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,I kept all your stuff I ll go get it,10,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,You want to give her a hand with that,9,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Mmm,1,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,You don t remember anything,5,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,I see flashes Little moments but I can t tell what s real If I could just piece together what happened that morning maybe it ll all make sense,29,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,You woke me up banging on my door at dawn Your usual move Back then we had to get up so early the Air Force still wasn t letting women fly combat so testing Lawson s planes was our only shot at doing something that mattered And you wanted to race to base in your old Mustang and I wasn t about to argue cause I knew my Camaro would dominate But you cheated took a shortcut,77,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Since when is a shortcut cheating,6,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,Since it violates the pre determined rules of engagement,9,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,I definitely don t remember those,6,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,Mmm of course you don t both Maria and Vers laugh for a bit When I got to the hanger Lawson was agitated she said she had lives to save She was trying to take the Aces up herself but you said,42,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,If there were lives at stake I would fly the plane,11,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,Yup Big hero moment The kind of moment we ve both been waiting for The Doc was always unique That s why I liked her But now you re saying she s from another planet,35,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,I know this must be hard for you,8,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,What this part right here No no Know what s hard Losing my best friend in a mission so secret they act like it never even happened Hard is knowing you were out there somewhere too damn stubborn to die And now you come up in here after years with your super charged fire hands and you expect me to call you I don t even know what Vers Is that really who you are now,76,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,I don t know,4,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,Come look,2,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,This is me and you on Halloween,7,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,I m Amelia Earhart and you re Janis Joplin Oh this is you when you were little you didn t get along with your parents so Mom said we became your real family,33,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,This is us on Christmas I got more,8,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,Here s another picture of when you were little And this is how you right after you graduated Monica continues to talk but the words start to mix together,29,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,Oh wait I forgot your jacket Mom doesn t let me wear it anymore after I spilled ketchup on it,20,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,That was all that survived the crash Or so we thought,11,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Don t answer that,4,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,It s just my neighbor,5,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,They can change into anyone,5,captain_marvel
Tom,Hi there,2,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,What do you want,4,captain_marvel
Tom,Ummm,1,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,Hey Tom This is my friend Carol,7,captain_marvel
Tom,Pleased to meet you Yow Static electricity out here s no joke I noted that peculiar bird you got parked by the road and I was just wondering if you d mind if I bring the boys over to get a closer looksie,43,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,A closer looksie,3,captain_marvel
Tom,Yeah,1,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,To see the bird parked out by the road You re really working overtime to sell this one aren t you Talos,22,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,I m sorry Tom this isn t really a good time I ll come by tomorrow Okay,17,captain_marvel
Tom,Uhh,1,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,Okay,1,captain_marvel
General Talos,You know you really should be kinder to your neighbors You never know when you re gonna need to borrow some sugar,22,captain_marvel
General Talos,Now hang on a second before you go swinging those jazz hands around making a mess in your friend s house and it s a lovely home,27,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,Oh my God What the hell,6,captain_marvel
General Talos,No one s gonna hurt the girl Just don t kill me That would really complicate the situation,18,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,I m about five seconds from complicating that wall with some ugly ass Skrull brains,15,captain_marvel
General Talos,I m sorry I simmed your boss But now I stand before you as my true self Without deception,19,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,And who is that out there,6,captain_marvel
General Talos,Okay that s a fair point But I m sure that you understand I had to take some precautions I saw you crush of my best men with your hands bound I just wanna talk,35,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Last time we talked I ended up hanging from my ankles,11,captain_marvel
General Talos,That was before I knew who you were Before I found what made you different from the others I have an audio recording from Pegasus of your voice from a plane crash six years ago On a device I believe you call a black box,45,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,They told me it was destroyed in the crash How d you get it,14,captain_marvel
General Talos,Does she not understand Young lady I have a special skill that kinda allows me to get into places I m not supposed to be,25,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,Call me young lady again and I m gonna put my foot in a place it s not supposed to be,21,captain_marvel
General Talos,Am I supposed to guess where that is,8,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,,0,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,Your ass,2,captain_marvel
General Talos,Okay I get it We re all a little on edge here But look I just need your help decoding some coordinates If you sit down you listen to this I assure you it ll be worth your while,39,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Call your buddy back inside and I ll listen,9,captain_marvel
General Talos,Deal,1,captain_marvel
General Talos,Oh my God Get that thing away How d that get in here,13,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,The cat This isn t what you re afraid of is it,12,captain_marvel
General Talos,That s not a cat That s a Flerken,9,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,A Flerken Fury laughs,4,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,Mom,1,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,Why can t I listen to,6,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,What s happening,3,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,It s loading,3,captain_marvel
Wendy Lawson,Punch in the coordinates,4,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Copy that Where are we going Doc,7,captain_marvel
Wendy Lawson,My laboratory,2,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Your laboratory What do you mean,6,captain_marvel
Wendy Lawson,Oh no,2,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Is that Wait what is that It s not showing up on my radar,14,captain_marvel
Wendy Lawson,Go Carol Fly,3,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,That s no MIG Lawson Who the hell are they,10,captain_marvel
Wendy Lawson,Those are the bad guys Fly faster now,8,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Yes ma am Vers pushes a lever forward causing the plane to speed up The plane following them als also speeds up to catch them The dogfight between the two planes continue with Vers pushing the lever sideways in an effort to escape the other plane What do they want,50,captain_marvel
Wendy Lawson,Me My work I never should have brought you along,10,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Here come some G s Vers pulls the lever backwards causing the plane to flip in the air After the flip Vers and Lawson are trailing the other plane However when Vers fires the other plane fires back They re firing backward Hold on Vers pushes the lever sideways and the plane tilts into another revolution However the plane is hit and the wing bursts into flames Vers struggles to regain control of the plane but fails to do so,80,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Bail out Bail out Bail out Stay with me Lawson Vers ejects the cockpit from the plane and struggles to regain control Once Vers has aligned the plane parallel to the ground the plane crashes into a beach,38,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,Danvers do you copy,4,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Yeah I copy We hit ground,6,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,Can anyone hear me,4,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Yeah I copy Doc,4,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Your blood it s blue,5,captain_marvel
Wendy Lawson,Yeah but uh how s my hair Help me out,10,captain_marvel
Wendy Lawson,I have to destroy it before they get here,9,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,What Lawson,2,captain_marvel
Wendy Lawson,You remember what I said about our work here What it s for,13,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,To end wars,3,captain_marvel
Wendy Lawson,Yeah But the wars are bigger than you know Damn it My name is not Lawson My real name is Mar Vell and I come from a planet called Hala,30,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,I would say that your delusional but we just got shot down by a spaceship and your blood is blue,20,captain_marvel
Wendy Lawson,Listen I spent half my life fighting a shameful war Now skedaddle before you give me any more regrets Just remember the coordinates okay You ve got to save them without me,32,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Save who How,3,captain_marvel
Wendy Lawson,I ve got to blow this engine before they find it,11,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,We have no interest in hurting you,7,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,No Because all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression,11,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,The energy core where is it,6,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Pararescue s on the way You have two minutes until you re surrounded,13,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,Then I see no reason to prolong this conversation,9,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,No wait Vers gestures towards the engine of the plane You mean that energy core,15,captain_marvel
Minn-Erva,Commander she s still moving Permission to fire,8,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,Hold your fire,3,captain_marvel
Minn-Erva,There s nothing left The core has been destroyed,9,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,She absorbed its power She s coming with us,9,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,He lied to me,4,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Everything that I knew was a lie,7,captain_marvel
General Talos,Now you understand,3,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,What What do I understand now,6,captain_marvel
General Talos,Yon Rogg killed Mar Vell He killed her Because she found out that she was on the wrong side of an unjust war,23,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,No Your people are terrorists that kill innocents I saw the ruins on Torfa,14,captain_marvel
General Talos,Ruins that the Accusers are responsible for My people lived as refugees on Torfa Homeless ever since we resisted Kree rule and they destroyed our planet Now the handful of us that are left will be slaughtered next unless you will help me finish what Mar Vell started The coordinates you found would ve powered a lightspeed ship capable of carrying us to safety A new home where the Kree can t reach us,74,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,Lawson always told us that her work at Pegasus wasn t to fight wars but to end them,18,captain_marvel
General Talos,She wanted you to help us find the core,9,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Well I already destroyed it,5,captain_marvel
General Talos,No you destroyed the engine The core that powered it is in a remote location If you help us decode those coordinates we can find it,26,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,You ll use it to destroy us,7,captain_marvel
General Talos,We just want a home You and I lost everything at the hands of the Kree Can t you see it now You re not one of them,28,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,You don t know me You have no idea who I am I don t even know who I am,20,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,You are Carol Danvers You are the woman on that black box risking her life to do the right thing My best friend who supported me as a mother and a pilot when no one else did You re smart and funny and a huge pain in the ass And you are the most powerful person I knew way before you could shoot fire from your fist You hear me You hear me,73,captain_marvel
General Talos,I know I don t deserve your trust but you were our only lead We discovered that your energy signature matched Mar Vell s core Now we know why If only you knew the importance of it to me I just need your help decoding the coordinates to Mar Vell s lab,52,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Those weren t coordinates They re safe vectors,8,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Orbital positioning and velocity,4,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,You didn t find her lab on Earth because it s not on Earth,14,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,That was the location on the day of the crash six years ago If we track its course we ll find it in orbit right now,26,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,It s just basic physics,5,captain_marvel
General Talos,In orbit Was that so difficult to figure out I mean you re my science guy right,17,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Yon Rogg will catch up to you soon We ve got to get the core before he does,18,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Mmm You re going to space,6,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,In what,2,captain_marvel
Skrull Scientist,A few tweaks to your vessel should do it I can handle the modifications,14,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Hmm Your science guy,4,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Well I could use a co pilot,7,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,No No I I can t I can t leave Monica,11,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,Why It s okay I can stay with grandma and pop pop,12,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,There s no way I m going baby It s too dangerous,12,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,Testing brand new aerospace tech is dangerous Didn t you used to do that,14,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,Your plan is to leave the atmosphere in a craft not designed for the journey and you anticipate hostile encounters with a technologically superior foreign enemy Correct,27,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,That s what I m saying You have to go,10,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,Monica,1,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,You have the chance to fly the coolest mission in the history of missions And you re gonna give it up to sit on the couch and watch Fresh Prince with me I just think that you should consider the kind of example you re setting for your daughter,49,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Your Mom s lucky When they were handing out kids they gave her the toughest one Lieutenant Trouble,18,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,You remember,2,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Is that mine Carol looks at the jacket sitting in Monica s lap However Carol protests when Monica attempts to hand it over No no You hang onto it until I come back But there is something that I need your help with I can t wear these Kree colors anymore and since you re obviously the only person around here with any sense of style,66,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,No,1,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,Uh uh,2,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,Definitely not Both Carol and Monica laugh,7,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Well since we re on the same team,8,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,How do I look,4,captain_marvel
Monica Rambeau,Fresh,1,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,What took you so long,5,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,I m fine Thanks for asking,6,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,PRY B,2,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,No no codes That system is fallible as we ve learned,11,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Okay then let s do this,6,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,Who do I see when I commune with the Supreme Intelligence,11,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,The person you most admire and respect I guess But you would never tell me who,16,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,And what is your earliest memory of Hala,8,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,The transfusion Blue blood running through my veins,8,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,Whose blood,2,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Carol looks sideways confused and stumbed Hmm,7,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,That s my blood that s coursing through her veins,10,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,What have you done with her,6,captain_marvel
Skrull,You re too late,4,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,She knows,2,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,Ronan Skrulls have infiltrated C Come at once,8,captain_marvel
Ronan,For the good of all Kree Commander the infestation will be eradicated,12,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Passing and climbing,3,captain_marvel
General Talos,You know you really shouldn t have that thing on your lap,12,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Our little alliance with you is tenuous at best And as long as he continues to freak you out Fury picks up Goose and shoves him towards Talos face Talos jerks backward in his seat like that yeah I m gonna keep giving him all the love and hugs he needs right,52,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,Can I ask you something Do you just turn into anything you want,13,captain_marvel
General Talos,Ah well I have to see it first,8,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,Can you all do it,5,captain_marvel
General Talos,Physiologically yeah But it takes practice and um dare I say it talent to do it well,17,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Can you turn into a cat,6,captain_marvel
General Talos,What s a cat,4,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,What about a filing cabinet,5,captain_marvel
General Talos,Why would I turn into a filing cabinet,8,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,A venus fly trap I ll give you right now if you turn into a venus fly trap,18,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Switching engines from Scramjet to fusion Buckle up folks,9,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Hey Is this normal like space turbulence,7,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Pretty much,2,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,Locking in coordinate grid,4,captain_marvel
Maria Rambeau,Where is it,3,captain_marvel
General Talos,It s here It s gotta be here,8,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Well is it in front of all that nothing or behind it,12,captain_marvel

Maria Rambeau,We re not alone,4,captain_marvel
Soren,Talos,1,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,He didn t come here for the Tesseract,8,captain_marvel
Soren,It s okay We didn t know what to do Mar Vell warned us not to send a signal for any reason or the Kree would find us,28,captain_marvel
General Talos,You did the right thing,5,captain_marvel
General Talos,It s okay it s okay She s alright She s a friend,13,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,I m not gonna hurt you,6,captain_marvel
General Talos,She led me to you,5,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,I m so sorry I didn t know,8,captain_marvel
General Talos,Carol this is war My hands are filthy from it too But we re here now You found my family This is just the beginning There s thousands of us separated from each other scattered throughout the galaxy,38,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,If I played the same pinball machine for six years I d have some high scores too,17,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,Fraternizing with the enemy,4,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,What did you do to your uniform,7,captain_marvel
Minn-Erva,They got in her head Just like we thought,9,captain_marvel
Korath,The Supreme Intelligence will set her straight,7,captain_marvel
General Talos,You can see they re not soldiers let them go You can have me,14,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,And the core,3,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel,You lied to me,4,captain_marvel
Yon-Rogg,I made you a better version of yourself What s given can be taken away,15,captain_marvel
Supreme Intelligence,There she is Seems like you time on C jogged the old memory This jacket It s killer by the way,21,captain_marvel

Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Hey what do you say Yondu huh Me and you taking down a mark side by side like the old days,21,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Yondu Udonta,Let him go Oh You always did have a scrote boy That s why I kept you on as a young un,22,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1

Rocket,Attention idiots The lunatic on top of this craft is holding a Hadron Enforcer It s a weapon of my own design,22,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Yondu Udonta,What the hell,3,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Rocket,If you don t hand over our companions now he s gonna tear your ship a new one A very big new one,23,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1

Rocket,We were only gonna blow you up if they didn t turn you over,14,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,And how on earth were they gonna turn us over when you only gave them a count of five,19,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Rocket,Well we didn t have time to work out the minutiae of the plan This is what we get for acting altruistically,22,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Groot,I am Groot,3,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Rocket,They are ungrateful,3,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Gamora,What s important now is we get the Ravagers army to help us save Xandar,15,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Rocket,So we can give the Stone to Yondu who s just gonna sell to somebody even worse,17,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,We ll figure that part out later,7,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Gamora,We have to stop Ronan,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Rocket,How,1,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,I have a plan,4,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Rocket,You ve got a plan,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Yes,1,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Rocket,First of all you re copying me from when I said I had a plan,15,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,No I m not People say that all the time it s not that unique of a thing to say,20,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Rocket,Secondly I don t even believe you have a plan,10,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,I have part of a plan,6,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Drax the Destroyer,What percentage of a plan do you have,8,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Gamora,You don t get to ask questions after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere,14,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Drax the Destroyer,I just saved Quill,4,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,We ve already established that you destroying the ship that I m on is not saving me,17,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Drax the Destroyer,When did we establish it,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Like three seconds ago,4,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Drax the Destroyer,I wasn t listening I was thinking of something else,10,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Gamora,Oh,1,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Rocket,She s right you don t get an opinion What percentage,11,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,I don t know twelve percent,6,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Rocket,Twelve percent,2,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,That s a fake laugh,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Rocket,It s real,3,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Totally fake,2,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Rocket,That is the most real authentic hysterical laugh of my entire life because that is not a plan,18,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Gamora,It s barely a concept,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,You re taking their side,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Groot,I am Groot,3,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Rocket,So what it s better than eleven percent What the hell does that have to do with anything,18,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Thank you Groot Thank you See Groot s the only one of you who has a clue Guys Come on Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds He expects to hear this big plan of ours I need your help I look around at us you know what I see Losers I mean like folks who have lost stuff And we have Man we have All of us Our homes our families normal lives And usually life takes more than it gives but not today Today it s given us something It has given us a chance,98,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Drax the Destroyer,To do what,3,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,To give a shit For once not run away I for one am not gonna stand by and watch as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives,27,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Rocket,But Quill stopping Ronan it s impossible You re asking us to die,13,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Yeah I guess I am I,6,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Gamora,Quill I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies I will be grateful to die among my friends,20,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Drax the Destroyer,You are an honorable man Quill I will fight beside you And in the end see my wife and daughter again,21,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Groot,I am Groot,3,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Rocket,Oh what the hell I don t got that long a lifespan anyway Now I m standing You all happy We re all standing up now Bunch of jackasses standing in a circle,33,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Gamora,The stone reacts to anything organic The bigger the target the bigger the power surge,15,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,All Ronan s gotta do is touch the stone to the planet s surface and zap All plants animals Nova Corps,21,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Gamora,Everything will die,3,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,So Ronan does not make the surface Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole in the Dark Aster s starboard hull Then our craft and Yondu s will enter,31,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Kraglin,Won t there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside,9,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Drax the Destroyer,I think of Sakaaran as paper people,7,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Gamora,Once they know we re on board Ronan will isolate himself behind impenetrable security doors on deck Which I can disable by dismantling the power source,26,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,We ll make it to the flight deck and I ll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan,18,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Gamora,Once Ronan is dead we will retrieve the stone Use these devices to contain it If you touch it it will kill you,23,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,I ll contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us Hopefully they ll believe we re there to help,20,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Rocket,There s one more thing we need to complete the plan That guy s eye,15,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,No No we don t No we don t need that guy s eye,14,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1

Ravager Navigator,Ronan s fleet has been spotted and will arrive in t minus fifteen minutes,14,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Yondu Udonta,Remember boy At the end of all this I get the stone You cross me we kill you all Let s go get em boys,25,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1
Gamora,This is a terrible plan,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol1

Drax the Destroyer,How is that a priority,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Rocket,Blame Quill He s the one who loves music so much,11,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,I agree with Drax It s hardly important right now,10,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2

Gamora,He said the skin is too thick to be pierced from the outside so he,15,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,That doesn t make sense,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,I tried to tell,4,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Its skin is the same thickness from the inside as from the out,13,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,I REALIZE THAT,3,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Gamora there s a cut on its neck Rocket get it to look up,14,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Hey you giant Sea Monkey up here,7,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2

Drax the Destroyer,What,1,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Drax the Destroyer,What are they called again,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Anulax batteries,2,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Drax the Destroyer,Harbulary batteries,2,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,That s nothing like what I just said But they re worth thousands of units a piece Which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them,27,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Just be careful what you say around these folks They re easily offended and the cost of transgression is death,20,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Drax the Destroyer,Sounds judgmental for a bunch of golden morons,8,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,That s the kind of thing you might want to keep to yourself,13,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,I ll hold my tongue as long as they deliver what was promised,13,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ayesha,We thank you Guardians for putting your life on the line We could not risk the lives of our own Sovereign citizens,22,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ayesha,Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community impeccable both physically and mentally We control the DNA of our progeny germinating them in birthing pods,27,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,I guess I prefer making people the old fashioned way,10,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ayesha,Well perhaps someday you could give me a history lesson in the archaic ways of our ancestors for academic purposes,20,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Yeah I mean if it s for research that could be pretty,12,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Pretty repulsive I m not into that kind of casual,10,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Oh please Your people promised something in trade for our services Bring it and we shall gladly be on our way,21,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Family reunion Yaaaay,3,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ayesha,I understand she is your sister,6,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,She s worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar,15,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ayesha,Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries Do with her as you please,15,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Thank you High Priestess Ayesha,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ayesha,What is your heritage Mr Quill,6,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,My mother is from earth,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ayesha,And your father,3,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,He s not from Missouri that s all I know,10,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ayesha,I see it within you an unorthodox genealogy A hybrid that seems particularly reckless,14,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Rocket,You know they told me you people were conceited douchebags But that isn t true at all,17,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Rocket,Oh shit I m using my wrong eye again aren t I I m sorry That was meant to be behind your back,23,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Drax the Destroyer,Count yourself blessed they didn t kill you,8,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Rocket,You re telling me You wanna buy some batteries,9,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Rocket,Let s get baldy back to Xandar and retrieve that bounty,11,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,You all right,3,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,That stuff about my father Who does she think she is,11,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,I know you re sensitive about that,7,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,I m not sensitive about it I just don t know who he is,14,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Sorry if it looked like I was flirting with her I wasn t,13,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,I don t care if you were,7,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,I think you do care That s why I m apologizing,11,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Drax the Destroyer,Gamora is not the one for you Quill,8,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Drax the Destroyer,There are two types of beings in the universe Those who dance and those who do not,17,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Uh huh,2,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Drax the Destroyer,I first met my beloved at a war rally,9,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Drax the Destroyer,Everyone in the village flailed about dancing Except one woman My Ovette I knew immediately she was the one,19,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Drax the Destroyer,The most melodic song in the world could be playing and she wouldn t even tap her foot She wouldn t move a muscle One might assume she was dead,30,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Well that is pretty hot but,6,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Drax the Destroyer,It would make my nether regions ENGORGE,7,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,All right okay fascinating don t need to hear it I get your point I m a dancer and Gamora is not,22,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Drax the Destroyer,You just need to find a woman who is pathetic like you,12,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,I am hungry Hand me some of that yaro root,10,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,No It s not ripe yet And I hate you,10,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,You hate me You left me there while you stole that stone for yourself Yet here you stand a hero a Garden of the Galaxy,25,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2

Gamora,Why would we be the Gardens of the Galaxy,9,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,I don t know I thought it was stupid,9,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Yeah it would be,4,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,It s still wordy,4,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,I wasn t the one who thought of it,9,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,Your name doesn t matter I ll be free of these shackles soon enough and I ll kill you I swear,21,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,No You ll live out your days in a prison on Xandar wishing you could,15,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,We got an armed Sovereign fleet approaching from the rear,10,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Why would they do that,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Drax the Destroyer,Probably because Rocket stole some of their batteries,8,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Rocket,Dude,1,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Drax the Destroyer,Oh right He didn t steal one of those I don t know why they re after us What a mystery this is,23,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,What were you thinking,4,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Rocket,Dude it was really easy to steal,7,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,That s your defense,4,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Rocket,Come on You saw how that high priestess talked down to us I m teaching her a lesson,18,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Oh I didn t realize your motivation was altruism A shame the Sovereign have mistaken your intentions and are trying to kill us,23,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Rocket,Exactly,1,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,I WAS BEING SARCASTIC,4,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2

SOVEREIGN PILOT,Bloody hell,2,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,You re not killing anyone Those ships are all remotely piloted,11,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ayesha,What is the delay Admiral,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Admiral,High Priestess if we destroy their craft we risk destroying the batteries They re extraordinarily combustible and could in turn destroy the entire fleet,24,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ayesha,We have thousands of batteries and thousands of ships Our concern is their slight against our people We hired them and they steal from us It is heresy of the highest order,32,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Admiral,All command modules,3,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Admiral,Fire with the intent to kill,6,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,What s the closest habitable planet,6,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2

Gamora,Either one of you could have gotten us through that field if you had flown with what s between your ears instead of what s between your legs,28,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,If what s between my legs had a hand on it I guarantee I could have landed this ship,19,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,It s not funny Peter We almost died Because of your arrogance,12,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,More like because he stoled Anulax batteries,7,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2

Nebula,That s enough killing for today,6,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Taserface,Thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy,9,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2

Peter Quill / Star-Lord,THIS CHEERS SAM AND DIANE GUY AND GIRL ON A TV SHOW WHO DIG EACH OTHER BUT NEVER SAY IT CAUSE WHEN THEY DO THE RATINGS WOULD GO DOWN sort of thing,32,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,There is no unspoken thing between us,7,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Well that s a Catch Because if you said there was it would be spoken and then you d be a liar So by saying there isn t you re telling the truth and admitting there is,37,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,That s not,3,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2

Ego,Brandy you re a fine girl what a good wife you would be But my life my love my lady is the sea The sea calls the sailor back He loves the girl but that s not his place The sea calls upon him as history calls upon great men and sometimes we are deprived the pleasures of mortals,59,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Well you might not be mortal but ME,8,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,Death will remain a stranger to both of us as long as the light burns within the planet,18,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2

Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Doesn t eternity get boring,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,Not if you have a purpose Peter Which is why you re here I told you how all those years ago I had an unceasing impulse to find life,29,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,I didn t tell you how when I did find it it was all so disappointing,16,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,And that is when I came to a profound realization,10,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,My innate desire to seek out other life was not so that I could walk among that life,18,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,Peter I had found meaning,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,I see it Eternity,4,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2

Rocket,Shut up,2,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Yondu Udonta,I know you steal batteries you don t need and you push away anyone who s willing to put up with you cause just a little bit of love reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is,41,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2

Ego,I call it the Expansion It is my purpose And now it s yours as well,16,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,It s beautiful,3,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,Over thousands of years I implanted thousands of extensions of myself on thousands of worlds,15,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,I needed to fulfill life s one true purpose to grow and to spread covering all that exists until everything is me,22,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,What did she do to me,6,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Drax the Destroyer,She already told me everything,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,I only had one problem A single Celestial doesn t have enough power for such an enterprise But two Celestials well now that just might do,26,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,The bodies are his children,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,Out of all my labors the most beguiling was attempting to graft my DNA with that of another species I hoped the result of such a coupling would be enough to power the expansion,34,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,I had Yondu deliver some of them to me It broke the Ravager code but I compensated him generously And to ease his conscience I told him I would never hurt them,32,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,That was true They never felt a thing But one after the other they failed me None of them had the Celestial genes Until you Peter Out of all my spawn only you have carried the connection to the light,40,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,We need to find Peter now and get off this damn planet,12,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,Ego will have won him to his side by now He has a way of,15,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2

Gamora,No He s our friend,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,All any of you do is yell at each other You re not friends,14,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Drax the Destroyer,You re right We re family We leave no one behind Except maybe you,14,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,Oh my god,3,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,For the first time in my life I am truly not alone,12,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2

Ego,You think you love them But love is merely an evolutionary trick in the service of reproduction We are beyond such things,22,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Yes,1,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,NOW,1,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2

Ego,The expansion the reason for my very existence would be over So I did what I had to do But it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head,31,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,Wh what,2,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,I know that sounds bad,5,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,Who in the hell do you think you are,9,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill / Star-Lord,You killed my mother,4,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,I tried so hard to find the form that best suited you and this is the thanks I get,19,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,You really need to grow up,6,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Ego,I wanted to do this together But I suppose you ll have to learn by spending the next thousand years as a battery Star Lord,25,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Rocket,1,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Rocket,Keep that transmitter nearby so I can find you We re in an old piece of construction equipment Yondu once used to slice open the Bank of A askavaria,29,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2

Drax the Destroyer,What are you doing You could have killed us all crashing in here like that,15,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2
Rocket,Uh Thank you Rocket,4,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol2

Tony Stark / Iron Man,Iron Man That s kind of catchy It s got a nice ring to it I mean it s not technically accurate The suit s a gold titanium alloy but it s kind of evocative the imagery anyway,38,iron_man_1
Agent Phil Coulson,Here s your alibi,4,iron_man_1
Agent Phil Coulson,You were on your yacht,5,iron_man_1
Agent Phil Coulson,We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night and sworn statements from of your guests,18,iron_man_1

Agent Phil Coulson,That s what happened,4,iron_man_1
Agent Phil Coulson,Just read it word for word,6,iron_man_1
Tony Stark / Iron Man,There s nothing about Stane here,6,iron_man_1
Agent Phil Coulson,That s being handled He s on vacation Small aircraft have such a poor safety record,16,iron_man_1
Tony Stark / Iron Man,But what about the whole cover story that it s a bodyguard He s my I mean is that That s kind of flimsy don t you think,28,iron_man_1
Agent Phil Coulson,This isn t my first rodeo Mr Stark Just stick to the official statement and soon this will all be behind you,22,iron_man_1
Pepper Potts,Agent Coulson I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help,16,iron_man_1

Pepper Potts,What night,2,iron_man_1
Tony Stark / Iron Man,You know,2,iron_man_1
Pepper Potts,Are you talking about the night that we danced and went up on the roof and then you went downstairs to get me a drink and you left me there by myself Is that the night you re talking about Thought so Will that be all Mr Stark,48,iron_man_1

Tony Stark / Iron Man,Thank you Been a while since I was in front of you I figure I ll stick to the cards this time There s been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop,41,iron_man_1
Christine Everhart,I m sorry Mr Stark but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared despite the fact that you,29,iron_man_1
Tony Stark / Iron Man,I know that it s confusing It is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely to make wild accusations or insinuate that I m a superhero,30,iron_man_1
Christine Everhart,I never said you were a superhero,7,iron_man_1
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Didn t Well good because that would be outlandish and fantastic I m just not the hero type Clearly With this laundry list of character defects all the mistakes I ve made largely public,34,iron_man_1

Tony (V.O.),Yes,1,iron_man_2
Christine (V.O.),And this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped with an undisclosed Stark high tech powered battle,15,iron_man_2

Tony Stark / Iron Man,I do not,3,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,You do not,3,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,I do not Well it depends on how you define the word weapon,13,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,The Iron Man weapon,4,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,My device does not fit that description,7,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,Well How would you describe it,6,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,I would describe it by defining it as what it is Senator,12,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,As,1,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,It s a high tech prosthesis That is That is That s actually the most apt description I can make of it,22,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,It s a weapon It s a weapon Mr Stark,10,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Please if your priority was actually the well being of the American citizen,13,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America,20,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Well you can forget it I am Iron Man The suit and I are one To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution depending or what state you re in You can t have it,48,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,Look I m no expert,5,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,In prostitution Of course not You re a senator Come on,11,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,I m no expert in weapons We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons I d now like to call Justin Hammer our current primary weapons contractor,29,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance,27,iron_man_2
Justin Hammer,Absolutely I m no expert I defer to you Anthony You re the wonder boy Senator if I may I may well not be an expert but you know who was the expert Your dad Howard Stark Really a father to us all and to the military industrial age Let s just be clear he was no flower child He was a lion We all know why we re here In the last six months Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities And yet he insists it s a shield He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it I wish I were comforted Anthony I really do I d love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house but this ain t Canada You know we live in a world of grave threats threats that Mr Stark will not always be able to foresee Thank you God bless Iron Man God bless America,160,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,That is well said Mr Hammer The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber,20,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Rhodey What,2,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Hey buddy I didn t expect to see you here,10,iron_man_2
James Rhodes / War Machine,Look it s me I m here Deal with it Let s move on,14,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,I just,2,iron_man_2
James Rhodes / War Machine,Drop it,2,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,All right I ll drop it,6,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon complied by Colonel Rhodes And Colonel for the record can you please read page paragraph four,28,iron_man_2
James Rhodes / War Machine,You re requesting that I read specific selections from my report Senator,12,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,Yes sir,2,iron_man_2
James Rhodes / War Machine,It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner,19,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,I understand A lot of things have changed today So if you could just read,15,iron_man_2
James Rhodes / War Machine,You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect the summery of my final,19,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,Just read it Colonel I do Thank you,8,iron_man_2
James Rhodes / War Machine,Very well As he does not operate within any definable branch of government Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation and to her interests I did however go on to summarise that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh three liabilities and that it would be in our interest,55,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,That s enough Colonel,4,iron_man_2
James Rhodes / War Machine,to fold Mr Stark,4,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,That s enough,3,iron_man_2
James Rhodes / War Machine,into the existing chain of command Senator,7,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,I m not a joiner but I ll consider Secretary of Defence if you ask nice,16,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,We can amend the hours a little bit,8,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,I d like to go on and show if I may the imagery that s connected to your report,19,iron_man_2
James Rhodes / War Machine,I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images to the general public at this time,17,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,With all due respect Colonel I understand And if you could just narrate those for us we d be very grateful Let s have the images,26,iron_man_2
James Rhodes / War Machine,Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are in fact attempts at making manned copies of Mr Stark s suit This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground,35,iron_man_2
James Rhodes / War Machine,indicating that these suits are quite possibly at this moment operational,11,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Hold on a second buddy Let me see something here Boy I m good I commandeered your screens I need them Time for a little transparency Now let s see what s really going on,35,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,What is he doing,4,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,If you will direct your attention to said screens I believe that s North Korea,15,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,Can you turn that off Take it off,8,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Iran,1,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,No grave threat here Is that Justin Hammer How did Hammer get in the game,15,iron_man_2

Justin Hammer,I d like to point out that that test pilot survived,11,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,I think we re done is the point that he s making I don t think there s any reason,20,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,The point is you re welcome I guess,8,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,For what,2,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Because I m your nuclear deterrent It s working We re safe America is secure You want my property You can t have it But I did you a big favour,31,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,I ve successfully privatised world peace,6,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,What more do you want For now I tried to play ball with these ass clowns,16,iron_man_2
Senator Stern,you Mr Stark you buddy We re adjourned We re adjourned for today,13,iron_man_2

J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision,We are up to ounces a day to counteract the symptoms sir,12,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Check palladium levels,3,iron_man_2
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision,Blood toxicity It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition Another core has been depleted,22,iron_man_2
Tony Stark / Iron Man,God they re running out quick,6,iron_man_2
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision,I have run simulations on every known element and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core,20,iron_man_2
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision,You are running out of both time and options Unfortunately the device that s keeping you alive is also killing you,21,iron_man_2
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision,Miss Potts is approaching I recommend that you inform her,10,iron_man_2

Aldrich Killian,But as I looked out over that city nobody knew I was there nobody could see me no one was even looking I had a thought that would guide me for years to come Anonymity Tony Thanks to you it s been my mantra ever since Right You simply rule from behind the scenes Because the second you give evil a face a bin Laden a Gaddafi a Mandarin you hand the people a target,75,iron_man_3

Thor,COMING TOO He has an army called the Chitauri They re not of Asgard or any world known He means to lead them against your people They will win him the earth In return I suspect for the Tesseract,39,the_avengers
Steve Rogers / Captain America,SERIOUSLY An army From outer space,6,the_avengers
Bruce Banner / Hulk,So he s building another portal That s what he needs Erik Selvig for,14,the_avengers
Thor,Selvig,1,the_avengers
Bruce Banner / Hulk,He s an astrophysicist,4,the_avengers
Thor,He s a friend,4,the_avengers
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow,Loki has him under some kind of spell along with one of ours,13,the_avengers
Steve Rogers / Captain America,I wanna know why Loki let us take him He s not leading an army from here,17,the_avengers
Bruce Banner / Hulk,I don t think we should be focusing on Loki That guy s brain is a bag full of cats you could smell crazy on him,26,the_avengers

Tony Stark / Iron Man,It s a stabilizing agent walks in with Coulson to COULSON I ll fly you there Keep the love alive Means the portal won t collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD,33,the_avengers
TONY (CONT'D) (TO THOR),No hard feelings Point Break You ve got a mean swing referring to the Iridium Also it means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as Loki wants TO CREW Uh raise the mid mast ship the top sails That man is playing GALAGA Thought we wouldn t notice But we did covering his eye looks AROUND How does Fury do this,66,the_avengers
Agent Maria Hill,He turns,2,the_avengers
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Well that sounds exhausting The rest of the raw materials Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily Only major component he still needs is a power source A high energy density something to kick start the cube,39,the_avengers
Agent Maria Hill,When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics,9,the_avengers
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Last night The packet Selvig s notes the Extraction Theory papers Am I the only one who did the reading,20,the_avengers
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Does Loki need any particular kind of power source,9,the_avengers
Bruce Banner / Hulk,He s got to heat the cube to a hundred and twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier,21,the_avengers
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect,12,the_avengers
Bruce Banner / Hulk,Well if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet,18,the_avengers

Nick Fury,WALKING IN Dr Banner is only here to track the cube I was hoping you might join him,18,the_avengers
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Let s start with that stick of his It may be magical but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon,22,the_avengers
Nick Fury,I don t know about that but it is powered by the cube And I d like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys,37,the_avengers
Thor,Monkeys I do not understand,5,the_avengers
Steve Rogers / Captain America,I do I understood that reference,6,the_avengers
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Shall we play doctor,4,the_avengers
Bruce Banner / Hulk,Let s play some,4,the_avengers
Bruce Banner / Hulk,The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig s reports on the Tesseract But it s gonna take weeks to process,21,the_avengers
Tony Stark / Iron Man,If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster we can clock this around six hundred teraflops,21,the_avengers

Tony Stark / Iron Man,You re tiptoeing big man You need to strut,9,the_avengers
Steve Rogers / Captain America,And you need to focus on the problem Mr Stark,10,the_avengers
Tony Stark / Iron Man,You think I m not Why did Fury call us and why now Why not before What isn t he telling us I can t do the equation unless I have all the variables,34,the_avengers

Tony Stark / Iron Man,That s just the prototype I m kind of the only name in clean energy right now,17,the_avengers
Bruce Banner / Hulk,referring to Tony So why didn t SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project I mean what are they doing in the energy business in the first place,29,the_avengers
Tony Stark / Iron Man,I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of SHIELD s secure files,19,the_avengers
Steve Rogers / Captain America,taken aback by that I m sorry did you say,10,the_avengers
Tony Stark / Iron Man,Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge In a few hours we ll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide holds out a bag of blueberries Blueberry,33,the_avengers
Steve Rogers / Captain America,Yet you re confused about why they didn t want you around,12,the_avengers
Tony Stark / Iron Man,An intelligence organization that fears intelligence Historically not possible,9,the_avengers
Steve Rogers / Captain America,I think Loki s trying to wind us up This is a man who means to start a war and if don t stay focused he ll succeed We have orders we should follow them,35,the_avengers

Jane Foster,The anomalies are always precipitated by geomagnetic storms She shows him a complicated CHART she s drawn in the book tracking occurrences and patterns,24,thor
Jane Foster,The last seventeen occurrences have been predictable to the minute I just don t understand Something catches Darcy s eye out the driver s side mirror She adjusts it In the distance ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert,46,thor
Darcy Lewis,Jane Jane SHUSHES her leafs through her notes The bottle of champagne begins to vibrate,15,thor
Jane Foster,There s got to be some new variable Or an equipment malfunction The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around them The computer monitors SQUELCH with static,30,thor
Darcy Lewis,I don t think there s anything wrong with your equipment The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it shakes more violently Jane and Selvig notice,28,thor
Darcy Lewis,Jane,1,thor
Jane Foster,What,1,thor
Darcy Lewis,I think you want to see this Darcy points out the window Jane and Selvig look out Over the desert,20,thor
Jane Foster,Holy Shatner,2,thor

Darcy Lewis,I think that was legally your fault,7,thor
Jane Foster,Get the first aid kit Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane concerned kneels next to the man Selvig hovers protectively She gently turns his head to the light and we see him clearly for the first time He is magnificently handsome long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted features She cups her hands around his face as if willing the life back into him,67,thor
Jane Foster,Come on big guy Do me a favor and don t be dead okay Open your eyes and look at me Suddenly he GROANS and she s startled then relieved as his eyes flutter open She looks deep into his confused azure eyes which at last focus on her own Locking onto them For a moment they each forget to breathe The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit She freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is,81,thor
Darcy Lewis,Wow Does he need CPR Because I know CPR A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels She looks up at Selvig Back to being a scientist,31,thor
Jane Foster,are dilating That s a good sign,7,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,We still have to get him to a hospital,9,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Immediately Jane Jane sighs and nods regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE above their heads A thought strikes her,18,thor
Jane Foster,Where did he come from They exchange puzzled looks as we move up through the last glowing remnants of the storm and into,23,thor
Heimdall,Questions they ve always asked questions this race called man on this planet they call earth Passionately longing to know how they are connected to the heavens,27,thor
Heimdall,In ages past they looked to us as gods for indeed so many times we saved them from calamity We tried to show them how their world was but one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos linked to all others by the branches of Yggdrasil We pull back until we see it YGGDRASIL Immense sprawling like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague shape of a TREE its branches of glowing energy stretching out into the black void of space,83,thor
Heimdall,the Worlds Tree Nine Realms in a universe of wonder beauty and terror that they barely comprehended We move in through Yggdrasil until we reach what looks like a galaxy slowly spinning before us,34,thor
Heimdall,But for all their thirst for knowledge they let our lessons fall into myth and dreams Where did he come from He came from us the proudest race of warriors the Worlds have ever seen He came from this the greatest Realm the universe has ever known We move through the galaxy s mists and astral matter then over and up through a band of prismatic color to reveal what s on the other side,75,thor
Heimdall,He came from Asgard,4,thor
Odin,Stares out at his kingdom The ravens fly up to the balcony land at his side,16,thor
Odin,Do you think he s ready,6,thor
Frigga,He thinks he is He has his father s confidence,10,thor
Odin,He ll need his father s wisdom,7,thor
Frigga,And his humility Odin reacts,5,thor
Frigga,Thor won t be alone Loki will be at his side to give him counsel Have faith in your sons,20,thor
Odin,Yes but Thor s still a boy He could be a great King Odin stops notices HIS HAND SHAKING It seems to be out of synch temporally with the rest of the world leaving a trail as it moves He stares at it determinedly concentrating trying to stop the strange event through the force of his sheer will,58,thor
Frigga,For once our son needs something we cannot provide,9,thor
Odin,I can fight it a little longer,7,thor
Frigga,No You ve put it off too long I worry for you He touches her cheek,16,thor
Odin,I ve destroyed demons and monsters devastated whole worlds laid waste to mighty kingdoms and still you worry for me,20,thor
Frigga,Always,1,thor
Odin,Not today Now come kiss your king while I m still king He pulls her close and they kiss,19,thor
Thor,Another,1,thor
the Hall.,We follow from behind and see at the other end massively shadowed on one of the great banners the shape of two great horns As Thor approaches the horn shapes move and then from the shadows at the side emerges LOKI wearing his horned headpiece Like Thor he is dressed for a great ceremony They stand by a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded throne room,72,thor
Thor,Have you ever known me to be nervous,8,thor
Loki,There was the time in Nornheim,6,thor
Thor,That wasn t nerves brother It was the rage of battle How else could I have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for Thor,38,thor
Loki,As I recall I was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease our escape,16,thor
Thor,Some do battle others just do tricks The Attendant stifles a laugh Loki notices doesn t like it He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant s hand EELS pour over the sides of the goblet slithering out and across the terrified Attendant s hand He SCREAMS hurls the goblet to the ground Loki chuckles,55,thor
Thor,Loki Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground They turn back to spilled wine the illusion shattered,19,thor
Thor,Now that was just a waste of good wine,9,thor
Loki,Just a bit of fun Right my friend The Attendant isn t so sure Thor dons his EAGLE WINGED,19,thor
Loki,Nice feathers,2,thor
Thor,You don t really want to start this again do you Cow,12,thor
Loki,I was being sincere,4,thor
Thor,You re incapable of sincerity,5,thor
Loki,Am I He looks his brother in the eye all pretense lost,12,thor
Loki,I ve looked forward to this day as long as you have You re my brother and my friend Sometimes I m envious but never doubt that I love you,30,thor
Thor,Thank you The two brothers take in the moment a beat then,12,thor
Loki,Give us a kiss,4,thor
Thor,Stop Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear,10,thor
Thor,How do I look,4,thor
Loki,Like a king They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN,11,thor
Loki,It s time,3,thor
Thor,You go ahead Loki casts him a wary look,9,thor
Thor,I ll be along Go on Loki heads inside the palace without his brother,14,thor
Fandral,Thank you love,3,thor
Fandral,Now who d like to polish my sword for me The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly his hands folded in front of him amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and the ceremony preparations going on around him A HELPFUL ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor Hogun turns his head gives him a look Intimidated the Attendant quickly backs away From behind we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her SWORD and set it on a table then her SHIELD then several HIDDEN DAGGERS and small yet intimidating WEAPONS We reveal that it s SIF looking radiant She eyes the weapons on the table,116,thor
Sif,I ll miss you,4,thor
Volstagg,I hope this goes quickly I m famished,8,thor
Volstagg,Are you attached to that pretty face of yours Because one more word and you won t be,18,thor
Fandral,My we are hungry aren t we The others laugh save Hogun Fandral turns to him,16,thor
Fandral,Go on Hogun Smile You can do it Even you Hogun the Grim Just one smile Hogun stares at him grimly,21,thor
Fandral,All right half a smile Look forget the smile just show some teeth,13,thor
Sif,Fandral is it true the famous Warriors Three are ready to meet any challenge,14,thor
Fandral,Name it Lady Sif,4,thor
Sif,Keep your mouth shut,4,thor
the palace.,A cold BREEZE blows past them,6,thor
Frigga,It s all right to be nervous,7,thor
Thor,Why does everyone keep saying that I m not nervous,10,thor
Frigga,You may be able to fool the rest of,9,thor
Thor,but never you I know,5,thor
Frigga,Thor just remember that you have something even the great Allfather never had,13,thor
Thor,And what is that,4,thor
Frigga,Me for a mother She smiles,6,thor
Frigga,Now don t keep your father waiting Frigga leaves,9,thor
Volstagg,Where is he,3,thor
Loki,He said he d be along Sif realizes the truth shakes her head in disapproval,15,thor
Volstagg,What,1,thor
Sif,He wants to make an entrance,6,thor
Fandral,Well if he doesn t show up soon he shouldn t bother Odin looks like he s ready to feed him to his ravens,24,thor
Loki,I wouldn t worry Father will forgive him He always does,11,thor
MJOLNIR,Roars up into the hall Thor strides cockily into the hall behind it catching it behind his back The CROWD erupts in CHEERS Thor spins his hammer with a flourish holds it up before the crowd basking in the moment relishing the adoration whipping his audience up into a frenzy,50,thor
Sif,Oh please Odin watches from the front not liking this showy display,12,thor
authority.,He raises Gungnir before him,5,thor
Odin,Gungnir Its aim is true its power strong With it I have defended Asgard and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms since the time of the Great Beginning And though the day has come for a new King to wield his own weapon that duty remains the same Thor Odinson my heir my first born,58,thor
Odin,So long entrusted with this mighty hammer Mjolnir Forged in the heart of a dying star from the sacred metal of Uru Only one may lift it Only one is worthy Who wields this hammer commands the lightning and the storm Its power has no equal as a weapon to destroy or as a tool to build It is a fit companion for a King,65,thor
and BLUE-SKINNED.,One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns to go But as they do the intricate latticework behind the Casket starts to separate and retract revealing something standing in the shadows behind it As the creatures walk away a fiery glow rises behind them They turn back around Now it s their turn to SCREAM,59,thor
Odin,Today I entrust you with the greatest honor in all the Nine Realms The sacred throne of Asgard I have sacrificed much to achieve peace So too must a new generation sacrifice to maintain that peace Responsibility duty honor These are not merely virtues to which we must aspire They are essential to every soldier and to every King The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the hall Thor turns back to face his father Odin looks upon his son with pride,96,thor
Odin,Thor Odinson do you swear to guard the Nine Realms,10,thor
Thor,I swear,2,thor
Odin,Do you swear to preserve the peace,7,thor
Thor,I swear,2,thor
Odin,Do you swear to cast aside all selfish ambition and pledge yourself only to the good of all the Realms Beat,21,thor
Thor,I swear,2,thor
Odin,Then on this day I Odin Allfather proclaim you Odin hesitates noticing a strange sight before him ICE creeps across the surface of the large banners around the hall making an eerie CRACKING sound Thor his comrades and the crowd see it too,43,thor
stop short.,Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the floor We don t see the blue skinned bodies of the Frost Giants clearly just catch glimpses of their twisted and smoldering remains on the floor They ve just lost a savage battle Badly Amidst them shrouded in shadow stands the black metal creature a fiery glow coming from within it It is THE DESTROYER It holds the Casket in its hands,70,thor
Sif,The Destroyer,2,thor
Fandral,I ve never been inside the Vault before It s said the Tesseract was once held here,17,thor
Sif,Shush Odin surveys the destruction,5,thor
Thor,The Jotuns must pay for what they ve done,9,thor
Odin,They have paid with their lives The Destroyer did its job and the Casket is safe All is well,19,thor
Thor,All is well They broke into the Weapons Vault If the Frost Giants had stolen even one of these,19,thor
Odin,But they didn t,4,thor
Thor,I want to know why they,6,thor
Thor,And if you hadn t taken it from them they would have laid waste to all the Nine Realms,19,thor
Odin,I have a truce with Laufey the Jotun King,9,thor
Thor,He just broke your truce We must act Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three,16,thor
Odin,Leave us Thor s comrades exit Odin eyes Thor as Loki watches,12,thor
Odin,And what action would you take,6,thor
Thor,March into Jotunheim as you once did teach them a lesson break their spirits so they ll never dare try to cross our borders again,25,thor
Odin,You re thinking only as a warrior,7,thor
Thor,This was an act of war,6,thor
Odin,It was the act of but a few doomed to fail,11,thor
Thor,They got this far,4,thor
Odin,We will find the breach in our defenses It will be found and it will be sealed,17,thor
Thor,As King of Asgard I would,6,thor
Odin,You are not King Not yet Thor sees in his father s face that he s pushed this as far as he can He backs away then leaves pushing through the doors so hard that they SLAM backwards behind him Odin watches him go,44,thor
massive tables.,From across the room Loki watches him,7,thor
Sif,Redecorating are we Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food aghast,11,thor
Volstagg,What s this,3,thor
Hogun,I told you they d cancel it,7,thor
Fandral,We thought that was just you being your normal cheery self Volstagg looks about the floor despairing,17,thor
Volstagg,All this food so innocent cast to the ground It breaks the heart Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall Loki calmly moves towards him,30,thor
Thor,It s unwise to be in my company right now brother,11,thor
Loki,Who said I was wise,5,thor
Thor,This was to be my day of triumph,8,thor
Loki,It will come In time,5,thor
Thor,Yes exactly,2,thor
Loki,But there s nothing we can do without defying Father Thor considers this looks at his hammer a gleam in his eye Loki can guess what he s thinking grows concerned,31,thor
Loki,No stop there I know that look,7,thor
Thor,It s the only way to ensure the safety of our borders,12,thor
Loki,It s madness,3,thor
Volstagg,Madness What sort of madness,5,thor
Loki,Nothing Thor was making a jest,6,thor
Thor,The safety of our Realm is no jest We re going to Jotunheim,13,thor
Fandral,What,1,thor
Sif,Thor of all the laws of Asgard this is one you must not break Loki looks on intrigued by the proceedings,21,thor
Fandral,This isn t like a journey to Earth where you summon a little lightning and thunder and the mortals worship you as a god This is Jotunheim,27,thor
Volstagg,And if the Frost Giants don t kill you your Father will,12,thor
Thor,My father fought his way into Jotunheim defeated their armies and took their Casket We d just be looking for answers,21,thor
Sif,It is forbidden,3,thor
Thor,My friends have you forgotten all that we ve done together He turns to Fandral,15,thor
Thor,Who brought you into the sweet embrace of the most exotic maidens in all of Yggdrasil,16,thor
Fandral,You did,2,thor
Volstagg,You did,2,thor
Hogun,You did He turns to Sif,6,thor
Thor,And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this Realm has ever known,26,thor
Sif,I did,2,thor
Thor,Come on You re not going to let my brother and me take all the glory are you Loki looks startled,21,thor
Loki,What,1,thor
Thor,You are coming with me,5,thor
Loki,Yes of course I won t let my brother march into Jotunheim alone I will be at his side,19,thor
Volstagg,And I,2,thor
Fandral,And I,2,thor
Hogun,And I The Warriors Three fight together,7,thor
Sif,I fear we ll live to regret this,8,thor
Volstagg,If we re lucky,4,thor
Thor,We must first find a way to get past Heimdall,10,thor
Volstagg,That will be no easy task It s said the Gatekeeper can see a single dew drop fall from a blade of grass a thousand worlds away,27,thor
Fandral,And he can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim,10,thor
Volstagg,Jest not He heareth all,5,thor
Fandral,Please Getting past him should be simple enough now since he seems to be letting Frost Giants sneak by under his nose Volstagg terrified calls out to the sky,29,thor
Volstagg,Forgive him He meaneth no offense Loki rejoins the group as Thor leads them onward,15,thor
Loki,Keep your weapons sheathed and your mouths closed This is going to take subtlety and sincerity not brute strength Leave it to me Loki dismounts and steps forward,28,thor
Heimdall,You re not dressed warmly enough Thor Loki and the others trade looks,13,thor
Loki,I m sorry,3,thor
Heimdall,The freezing cold of Jotunheim It will kill you all in time even Thor,14,thor
Heimdall,Or can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim Fandral looks gob smacked,13,thor
Fandral,That was just a bit of a jest really Loki goes into damage control,14,thor
Loki,You must be mistaken We re not,7,thor
Heimdall,For ages have I guarded Asgard and kept it safe from those who would do it harm In all that time never has an enemy slipped by my watch until this day I wish to know how that happened,39,thor
Thor,Then tell no one where we ve gone until we ve returned Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group pass Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki needles him,31,thor
Volstagg,What happened Your silver tongue turn to lead,8,thor
Loki,Get me off this bridge before it cracks under your girth Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh,17,thor
Heimdall,Be warned I will honor my sworn oath to protect this Realm as its Gatekeeper If your return threatens the safety of Asgard Bifrost will remain closed to you You ll be left to die in the cold wastes of Jotunheim,41,thor
Thor,I have no plans to die today,7,thor
Heimdall,None do Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel and the apparatus of the Observatory starts up,18,thor
Heimdall,All is ready You may pass,6,thor
Volstagg,Couldn t you just leave the bridge open for us,10,thor
Heimdall,To keep this bridge open would unleash the full power of the Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it,20,thor
Volstagg,Ah Never mind then Thor starts towards the Bifrost turns back to the others grins,15,thor
Thor,Come on Don t be bashful The others join him at his side then step towards the Bifrost Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom changing shape as if every atom of their being is being elongated by the pull of it In an instant they re jerked off the platform and inside the vortex,54,thor
Thor,Come on big fella Up With an effort Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the ice and tremendously relieved he proclaims,22,thor
Volstagg,This belt This belt is now my lucky belt I will never remove it Even when bathing,17,thor
Fandral,You bathe Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder at the frozen alien wasteland before them The whole planet is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice slowly breaking apart Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges and float off into space The planet s icy surface cracks and melts as far as the eye can see The ruins of a Jotun city lies in the distance,75,thor
Hogun,We shouldn t be here,5,thor
Thor,Too late now,3,thor
Fandral,Actually it s not We could turn right around hop back to Asgard share a mug by the fire Could be nice Thor ignore him heads off Loki looks around anxious,31,thor
Loki,Perhaps we should wait Thor turns back to his brother,10,thor
Thor,For what,2,thor
Loki,To survey the enemy To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance,13,thor
Volstagg,I m liking that Gauging surveying Particularly the distance part,10,thor
Thor,We know all we must It s time to act Thor heads on Reluctantly the others follow,17,thor
Sif,He s just got to swing his hammer,8,thor
Thor,It feels good doesn t it To be together again adventuring on another world,14,thor
Fandral,Adventuring Is that what we re doing,7,thor
Thor,What would you call it,5,thor
Fandral,Freezing,1,thor
Volstagg,Starving,1,thor
Sif,Whining,1,thor
Thor,How about a song to lift our spirits The others groan,11,thor
Hogun,No not that,3,thor
Sif,Please don t make us sing again,7,thor
Fandral,If I have to listen to Volstagg s singing voice one more time I ll fall on my own sword,20,thor
Sif,Well now I m on board She and Thor share a grin The party reaches the edge of the city its ancient structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling ravaged by warfare long ago A TEMPLE lies before them across a central plaza,44,thor
Sif,Where are they,3,thor
Thor,Hiding As cowards always do Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza Loki reluctantly follows They don t notice as SHADOWY FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby,32,thor
Laufey,What is your business here Asgardian The Jotun s voice itself sounds like cracking ice,15,thor
Thor,I speak only to your King Not to his foot soldiers,11,thor
Laufey,Then speak,2,thor
Laufey,I am Laufey King of this Realm,7,thor
Thor,And I am,3,thor
Laufey,We know who you are Odinson Why have you brought the stench of your blood into my world,18,thor
Thor,I demand answers Laufey stands sizing up Thor tries to piece this together,13,thor
Laufey,You demand,2,thor
Thor,How did your people get into Asgard,7,thor
Laufey,The house of Odin is full of traitors Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look disturbed by the Jotun King s words,24,thor
Thor,Do not dishonor my father s name with your lies,10,thor
Laufey,Your father is a murderer and a thief He stole what was ours and left our world in ruins We have the right to reclaim the Casket,27,thor
Thor,Not when you d use it to make war against other Realms Laufey laughs cold mocking,16,thor
Laufey,And why have you come here To make peace You long for battle You crave it I see you for what you are Thor Odinson Nothing but a boy trying to prove himself a man,35,thor
Thor,This boy has grown tired of your mockery Thor takes a step towards Laufey The other Jotuns step in front of Thor blocking his path We finally see the Frost Giants now terrifying blue skinned standing eight feet tall Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores him,49,thor
Loki,Thor stop and think Look around you We are outnumbered,10,thor
Thor,Know your place brother,4,thor
Laufey,You should listen to his counsel You know not what your actions would unleash Laufey steps out of the shadows,20,thor
Laufey,But I do Go now while I still allow it Thor simmers Loki speaks up,15,thor
Loki,We will accept your most gracious offer The others look to Thor imploringly Thor stares Laufey down a beat then relents He turns to leave His comrades breathe a sigh of relief and follow when a Frost Giant nearby mutters under his breath,43,thor
Laufey,Run back home little princess Thor stops in his tracks Loki goes white He knows what s coming,18,thor
Loki,Damn In one quick move Thor pulls Mjolnir swings it and KNOCKS the Jotun clear across the plaza The Asgardians reluctantly draw their weapons gather into a circle around Thor Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them,39,thor
Volstagg,Silly hammer Has a mind of its own ICE forms on the Jotuns bodies creating a FROZEN ARMOR around them extending off the ends of their arms like SWORDS One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral,38,thor
Fandral,I m hoping that s just decorative Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians swings at another Frost Giant His comrades form another circle around him separating him from the Jotuns as he whirls his hammer around once and catches it with a cocky grin He s enjoying this,48,thor
Thor,Next Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun,7,thor
Fandral,Well What move do you think,6,thor
Volstagg,I say we use The Norn s Revenge,8,thor
Fandral,At this close range I think The Alfheim Lunge is a better move,13,thor
Hogun,Shut up Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant then all hell breaks loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice As the Giant hurls an ice blade fist at him the grim warrior swings his mace over his head embedding it into the ice wall and hoists himself up dodging the Giant s blow and leaping over him Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant spins back dodges a swing from the first then pounds the Jotun with his mace Nearby Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her double bladed staff One knocks her viciously to the ground,113,thor
Sif,If you don t treat me like a lady I won t act like a lady She takes out the Jotun Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun finds himself at the edge of a deep crevasse The Giant sees he s vulnerable swipes at him But the Jotun s arm passes right through him The Giant stands there confused when THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the crevasse below The false Loki dissipates into nothingness,84,thor
Loki,Pathetic He turns back to the battle Two Jotuns come at him from either side He lets two daggers fly felling both Giants at once Laufey nods to one of his guards a massive Jotun BRUTE The Brute leaps down from the balcony icing himself up then punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet It s a long range attack causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in front of Hogun sending the grim warrior flying back Across the plaza Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns,88,thor
Thor,Come on At least make it a challenge for me He sees the Brute coming at him The huge Jotun lands a tremendous blow sending Thor back across the ice Thor rises grins,33,thor
Thor,Now that s more like it He throws Mjolnir with all his strength knocking the Brute head over heels Thor raises his hand Mjolnir slows in mid air then flies back to his grasp,34,thor
Thor,Ugly and stupid Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants but she s knocked to the ground by another It raises its weapon above her Hogun sees Sif in danger He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his sleeve and hurls it at Sif s attacker hitting him square in the chest The Jotun falls dead,55,thor
Sif,I m so glad I taught him how to do that Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant getting a couple good hits in,23,thor
Volstagg,You may want to put some ice on that The Frost Giant fights back but Volstagg manages to grip in a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind Volstagg fends him off then turns the first one loose,41,thor
Volstagg,You may be taller but I m wider Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him flying Another Jotun grabs Volstagg squeezing him tightly and sending him crashing to the ground,34,thor
Volstagg,It s not too late for you to surrender Volstagg recovers and fights on The Jotun grabs Volstagg s bare arm The warrior s skin begins to freeze from the Jotun s grasp a BLACKNESS spreading from it necrotizing Volstagg s flesh The warrior SHOUTS in pain,47,thor
Volstagg,Don t let them grab hold of you He takes a swig enjoying the brief respite then rejoins the battle Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant s chest but the sword stops mid ice layer The Giant delivers a bone breaking blow to Volstagg s face and the warrior drops to one knee Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him In one quick move she leaps up and off of Volstagg s back using her boot to plunge Volstagg s blade deep into the Giant s chest standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground,100,thor
Volstagg,Thank you my lady But I nearly had him,9,thor
Sif,Of course you did Nearby a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS hurling them at Sif Sif raises her shield barely in time as the bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it She races into the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them out,49,thor
Volstagg,Hang on Volstagg swings his weapon wildly hacking at the ice around Hogun s legs to free him Hogun looks down suddenly worried as Volstagg s blade cuts deep and perilously close to hacking into Hogun s legs,38,thor
Hogun,Watch the legs,3,thor
Fandral,You really think your icicles are a match for Asgardian steel Fandral lunges at the Giant The Jotun knocks his blade away,22,thor
Fandral,Fair enough Fandral moves on him again but the Giant grabs Fandral s sword and snaps it in half,19,thor
Fandral,Could we stop just a moment while I get another sword Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword The Jotun then lunges at Fandral who ducks just in time grabs hold of the Giant s sword and redirects it stabbing the Giant through with his own weapon The Jotun staggers back then reaches down and swipes at a pool of water sending up a spray that freezes in mid air forming into an ICE STALAGMITE It impales Fandral rendering him helpless,82,thor
them off.,Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral,10,thor
Volstagg,That s unfortunate He hurries to his wounded comrade,9,thor
Fandral,I may need a bit of help Not a good look is it,13,thor
Volstagg,Just try not to bleed,5,thor
Fandral,How s the face,4,thor
Volstagg,Flawless Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice stalagmite Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost Giants The Giant grabs hold of Loki s gloved wrists Loki pulls his hands free of the gloves which are still in the Giant s grasp revealing Loki s skin beneath The wounded Jotun sees his chance grabs hold of Loki s bare arm Loki looks at his arm prepared for the worst But instead of the blackness of necrotizing flesh Loki s arm turns BLUE like the Frost Giant s own skin The blueness spreads painlessly up Loki s arm He stares at it confused The Frost Giant is thrown as well distracted by the unexpected phenomenon Loki takes advantage of the distraction KICKS the Giant,131,thor
Thor,Come on But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun the Frost Giants seize the opportunity A group of Jotuns swarm Thor from all sides keeping him separate from his weapon Mjolnir falls to the ground A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the ground to no avail Now free the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg slings him over his shoulder and the warriors start to leave From his balcony Laufey looks upon the battlefield decides it s time to pull out the big guns He touches a wall of the palace An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch across the wall of the palace and down to the ground below The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their feet,128,thor
Loki,That can t be good,5,thor
Volstagg,Yes it could Might be an early spring They look down suddenly filled with dread when they see shadowy figures moving in the ice dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS awakening beneath the surface rousing to join the battle Loki turns to his brother who battles a group of the Giants,49,thor
Loki,Thor we must go Thor still without his hammer fights his Jotun foes mercilessly a man consumed by blood lust Loki sees the look on his brother s face the savage thrill of the heat of battle,37,thor
Thor,Then go,2,thor
Sif,There are too many of them,6,thor
Thor,I can stop them The others hesitate Jotuns break up through the ice all around them,16,thor
Sif,Thor But Thor ignores his comrades continues fighting,8,thor
Volstagg,Run Reluctantly the group flees back toward the inner edge of the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give chase Thor battles valiantly but there s just too many of them The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now as he disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice After a,57,thor
Volstagg,What s Thor done,4,thor
Loki,Likely killed us all As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians they open their mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG The swirling mists quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them The Asgardians stand in the mist unable to see Hogun takes a step back the ice cracking beneath him They dare not move for fear of falling through into the void below Thor sees he s put his friends in even greater danger He raises Mjolnir high SUMMONING THE WINDS They lift him off the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his comrades,98,thor
Thor,Loki we have to see Loki raises his arms concentrates the mists dissipating But as they do the Asgardians see before them the faces of the Frost Giants And there are HUNDREDS of them too many even for a Thunder God,41,thor
ODIN ALLFATHER,Astride his powerful eight legged steed SLEIPNIR He s clad in battle armor Gungnir in his hand an imposing sight,20,thor
Odin,Laufey End this,3,thor
Laufey,Your boy sought this out,5,thor
Odin,You re right These are the actions of a boy Treat them as such You and I can stop this before there s further bloodshed Unseen by Odin and the others Laufey starts to form an ice blade at the end of his arm,44,thor
Laufey,We are beyond diplomacy now Allfather He ll get what he came for war and death Odin looks grim determined,20,thor
Odin,So be it Without warning Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin but Odin is quicker The Allfather brings his spear down upon the ice Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards in a wave the ice cracking beneath their feet The other Frost Giants turn tail and run Thor watches the fleeing Jotuns with delight,57,thor
Thor,Now We ll finish them together,6,thor
Odin,Silence Odin raises his spear The hole in the sky opens the Bifrost energy blasting forth from it The Bifrost envelops the Asgardians yanks them off the ground and up through the hole The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent Laufey stares up after them contemptuously,48,thor
Thor,Why did you bring us back,6,thor
Odin,Do you realize what you ve done What you ve started,11,thor
Thor,I was protecting my home,5,thor
Odin,You cannot protect your friends How can you hope to protect a kingdom Odin turns to the others,18,thor
Thor,There won t be a kingdom to protect if you re afraid to act Odin stares at him,18,thor
Thor,Whatever the cost the world must know that the new King of Asgard will not be held in contempt,19,thor
Odin,That s pride and vanity that talks Not leadership Have you forgotten everything I ve taught you What of a warrior s patience cunning,24,thor
Thor,While you wait and be patient the Nine Realms laugh at us The old ways are done You d stand giving speeches while Asgard falls,25,thor
Odin,You re a vain greedy cruel boy,7,thor
Thor,And you are an old man and a fool The whole world seems to stop at Thor s words Odin falls quiet When he speaks again there s something terrifying beneath the calmness of his words,36,thor
Odin,A fool yes I was a fool to think you were ready Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly,19,thor
Loki,Father,1,thor
Odin,Thor Odinson You have disobeyed the express command of your King Through your arrogance and stupidity you have opened these peaceful Realms and innocent lives to the horrors of war The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory s control panel The turret turns the Bifrost energy building along with Odin s rage It FIRES as the Bifrost opens at the end of the platform creating a portal behind Thor Odin turns angrily to his son,74,thor
Odin,You are unworthy of this Realm Odin RIPS a disc off Thor s chest,14,thor
Odin,unworthy of your title He rips away Thor s cloak,10,thor
Odin,unworthy of the loved ones you ve betrayed I hereby take from you your powers Odin extends his hand towards his son Mjolnir goes flying from Thor s grasp into Odin s hand,33,thor
Odin,In the name of my father A FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the hammer and hits Thor disintegrating the right arm of his armor and part of the chest piece,30,thor
Odin,and of his father before Another strike disintegrates the remainder of Thor s armor including the cape and torn away disc on the floor,24,thor
Odin,I cast you out Odin thrusts Mjolnir before him and with a CRACK OF THUNDER Thor is hurled backwards into the open Bifrost and disappears in the vortex,28,thor
Darcy Lewis,I think that was legally your fault,7,thor
Jane Foster,Get the first aid kit,5,thor
Thor,Thor opens his eyes to see Jane Foster staring at him concerned She looks vulnerable and beautiful,17,thor
Darcy Lewis,Wow Does he need CPR Because I know CPR,9,thor
Jane Foster,Uh thanks Are you okay Thor searches the ground,9,thor
Thor,Hammer,1,thor
Darcy Lewis,Yeah we can tell you re hammered That s pretty obvious Jane notices something on the ground around them She shines her flashlight down at the sand,27,thor
Jane Foster,Erik look at this He joins her at her side and sees it A faint discernible pattern is etched into the sand They exchange a look Amazed and excited Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and snaps some photos of the runes A breeze begins to blow them away,49,thor
Jane Foster,We ve got to move fast before anything changes,9,thor
Jane Foster,We need soil samples light readings everything She pulls out a light meter holds it up takes some readings jots them down in her notebook Selvig looks at Thor who stares up at the sky,35,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Jane we need get him to a hospital Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the cannister,20,thor
Jane Foster,Not right now It ll take too long County s an hour away We ll drop him off after we re done here Selvig looks uncertain,26,thor
Thor,Father Heimdall I know you can hear me Open the bridge,11,thor
Jane Foster,Okay you and Darcy take him to the hospital I ll stay here,13,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,You expect me to leave you alone in the middle of the desert Thor turns to the others frustrated,19,thor
Thor,You What world is this The group is intimidated by his fervor,12,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,It s all right my friend We re going to get you some help Selvig touches Thor s shoulder Thor shoves him off grows agitated belligerent,26,thor
Thor,Where am I Answer me Darcy reaches into her fanny pack pulls something out of it Jane looks on concerned,20,thor
Jane Foster,Erik just back away,4,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,You re in the desert outside the town of Puente Antiguo,11,thor
Thor,What Realm Alfheim Nornheim,4,thor
Darcy Lewis,Uh New Mexico Darcy raises a TASER at him Thor looks at the weapon unsure what to make of it,20,thor
Thor,You dare threaten Thor with so puny,7,thor
Darcy Lewis,What He was freaking me out,6,thor
Admissions Nurse,Name,1,thor
Jane Foster,He said it was Thor The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer one key at a time Jane watches as Thor is wheeled out of the room,28,thor
Jane Foster,I ve never met him before,6,thor
Darcy Lewis,Until she hit him with the car,7,thor
Jane Foster,Grazed him actually,3,thor
Jane Foster,I told you I don t know him I just want to make sure he s okay,17,thor
Admissions Nurse,I m going to need a name and contact number,10,thor
Jane Foster,Jane Foster,2,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Oh for God s sake He reaches over Jane s shoulder and hands the Nurse his business card,18,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Here Let s go Selvig Darcy and Jane head out,10,thor
Nurse,Hi Just taking a little blood,6,thor
Thor,How dare you attack the son of Odin,8,thor
Nurse,I need some help,4,thor
Nurse,We re trying to help you,6,thor
Thor,Then bring me a healing stone you savages He hurls one of them off smashing against a wall Now a couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas all struggling to hold Thor down Medical equipment goes flying furniture overturned,41,thor
Orderly,What the hell is this guy on,7,thor
Thor,You re no match for the Mighty Thor struggles a beat then passes out,14,thor
Townie,Huh,1,thor
Townie,Huh,1,thor
Jane Foster,Darcy when you re done take the soil samples to Professor Meyers in geology Remind him he owes me,19,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,We might want to perform a spectral analysis,8,thor
Jane Foster,We,1,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,I flew all the way out here might as well make myself useful This is the offer Jane s been waiting for She gets up inserts the piece of equipment she s been working on into a rack mounted server,40,thor
Jane Foster,You know what would be really useful Do you still have that friend at LIGO,15,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,She was more than a friend,6,thor
Jane Foster,Could you call in a favor,6,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,You don t think this was just a magnetic storm,10,thor
Jane Foster,If I m right their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night s event,17,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Meaning Jane heads over to a computer monitor Selvig follows,10,thor
Jane Foster,Meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger,7,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,How big are we talking about Jane indicates the footage on the monitor As the last of the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky there appears to be a blister in space bulging out in convex and covered with stars,41,thor
Jane Foster,I think the lensing around the edges is characteristic of an Einstein Rosen Bridge,14,thor
Darcy Lewis,A what,2,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,I thought you were a science major,7,thor
Darcy Lewis,Political Science Selvig shoots Jane a confused look Jane shrugs,10,thor
Jane Foster,She was the only applicant,5,thor
Jane Foster,Erik look,2,thor
Jane Foster,What do you see here,5,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Stars,1,thor
Jane Foster,Yes But not our stars She spreads out a STAR CHART barely able to contain her excitement,17,thor
Jane Foster,This is the star alignment for our quadrant this time of year So unless Ursa Minor decided to take the day off those are someone else s constellations Selvig s intrigued in spite of himself Darcy pulls another frame grab of the Bifrost footage from the printer and hangs it on the wall when something in the image catches her eye,61,thor
Darcy Lewis,Hey check it out Jane and Selvig examine the photo amazed,11,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Is that,2,thor
Jane Foster,I think I left something at the hospital As Jane walks away we REVEAL the photo Inside the Bifrost funnel cloud is a FIGURE the vague but unmistakable shape of a MAN,32,thor
Frigga,How could you have done this,6,thor
Odin,Do you understand what he set in motion He s taken us to the brink of war,17,thor
Frigga,But banishment You would lose him forever He s your son,11,thor
Odin,What would you have done,5,thor
Frigga,I would not have exiled him to a world of mortals stripped of his powers to suffer alone I would not have had the heart for such cruelty,28,thor
Odin,That is why I m King,6,thor
Frigga,You can bring him back,5,thor
Odin,No His fate is in his own hands now,9,thor
Thor,It s not possible He tries again mustering all his strength One of his hands slips free from its restraint,20,thor
Admissions Nurse,I m sorry only relatives can visit patients,8,thor
Admissions Nurse,I thought you said you didn t know him,9,thor
Jane Foster,I meant I barely know him anymore The man he s become He s changed I mean what woman really knows her husband anyway,24,thor
Admissions Nurse,None of us dear He s in Room,8,thor
Jane Foster,Typical I just lost my most important piece of evidence,10,thor
Darcy Lewis,So now what,3,thor
Jane Foster,We find him,3,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Did you see what he did in there I don t know if finding him is the best idea,19,thor
Jane Foster,I want to know what that thing was and he may have the answers We don t have a choice,20,thor
Darcy Lewis,Oo kay She pulls out her taser and a can of mace,12,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,So we re just going to spend the rest of the day looking for him,15,thor
Jane Foster,However long it takes Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up when,14,thor
BAM!,She collides with Thor again dressed in stolen hospital scrubs Jane and Selvig exchange a look,16,thor
Jane Foster,I m so sorry I swear I m not doing that on purpose,13,thor
Thor,Blue sky one sun This is Earth isn t it,10,thor
Darcy Lewis,I think you may have hit him with the car one time too many,14,thor
Volstagg,We should never have let him go,7,thor
Sif,There was no stopping him,5,thor
Fandral,At least he s only banished not dead Which is what we d all be if that guard hadn t told Odin where we d gone,26,thor
Volstagg,How did the guard even know Loki stares at his arm,11,thor
Loki,I told him,3,thor
Fandral,What,1,thor
Loki,I told him to go to Odin after we d left Though he should be flogged for taking so long,20,thor
Volstagg,You told the guard,4,thor
Loki,I saved our lives And Thor s I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did,19,thor
Sif,Loki you re the only one who can help Thor now You must go to the Allfather and convince him to change his mind,24,thor
Loki,And if I do then what I love Thor more dearly than any of you but you know what he is He s arrogant He s reckless He s dangerous You saw how he was today Is that what Asgard needs from its King The others exchange glances torn Loki has a point He leaves the room Hogun stares after him,61,thor
Sif,He may speak about the good of Asgard but he s always been jealous of Thor,16,thor
Volstagg,True but we should be grateful to him He did save our lives,13,thor
Hogun,Laufey said there were traitors in the House of Odin The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun,18,thor
Fandral,Why is it every time you choose to speak it has to be something dark and ominous,17,thor
Hogun,A master of magic could easily bring three Jotuns into Asgard The others look to Hogun understanding the implication,19,thor
Volstagg,No Surely not,3,thor
Fandral,Loki s always been one for mischief but you re talking about something else entirely,15,thor
Sif,Who else could elude Heimdall s gaze with tricks of light and shadow,13,thor
Volstagg,The ceremony was interrupted just before Thor was named King,10,thor
Sif,We should go to the Allfather,6,thor
Fandral,And tell him what Oh by the way we think your son just betrayed the throne And do us a favor Bring back Thor There s a good fellow,29,thor
Sif,It s our duty If any of our suspicions are right then all of Asgard is in danger,18,thor
Odin,Stop Loki turns sees Odin hurrying into the room the Destroyer goes motionless the latticework rejoining before it Odin eyes Loki with dismay,23,thor
Loki,Am I cursed,3,thor
Odin,No Put the Casket down Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal his body quickly returning to its normal form and color He stares at his father,28,thor
Loki,What am I,3,thor
Odin,You re my son,4,thor
Loki,What more than that Odin doesn t answer He looks suddenly weary burdened Loki sizes him up realizes the truth,20,thor
Loki,The Casket wasn t the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day was it Odin looks him in the eye He can deny it no longer,27,thor
Odin,No,1,thor
Loki,Laufey s son He desperately struggles to make sense of it all,12,thor
Loki,Why You were knee deep in Jotun blood Why would you take me,13,thor
Odin,You were an innocent child,5,thor
Loki,You took me for a purpose what was it Odin doesn t answer,13,thor
Loki,Tell me,2,thor
Odin,I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day bring about an alliance bring about a permanent peace through you But those plans no longer matter,26,thor
Loki,So I am no more than another stolen relic locked up here until you might have use of me,19,thor
Odin,Why do you twist my words,6,thor
Loki,You could have told me what I was from the beginning Why didn t you,15,thor
Odin,You are my son My blood I wanted only to protect you from the truth,15,thor
Loki,Because I am the monster parents tell their children about at night,12,thor
Odin,Don t,2,thor
Loki,It all makes sense now Why you favored Thor all these years,12,thor
Odin,Listen,1,thor
Loki,Because no matter how much you claim to love me you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the Throne of Asgard Odin s body begins to shake he lifts his hand It starts to move out of synch temporarily leaving a trail the effect of the Odinsleep approaching Loki doesn t notice as Odin tries to fight it off,61,thor
Odin,Listen to me Loki strides away towards the exit,9,thor
Odin,Loki Odin starts towards him when the enormous mental emotional and physical strain of recent events finally takes its toll The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him His entire body now moves out of sync with the rest of the world leaving trails behind him as he staggers backwards Odin falls back against a wall his face contorting in a scream He collapses to the stone floor Loki shocked hurries to him He takes Odin in his arms calls out,80,thor
Loki,Guards,1,thor
cell phones.,They hear an approaching RUMBLE then clear a path as a large PICK UP TRUCK backs its way down the crater s edge An EAGER TOWNIE hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain from the back of the truck He fastens one end around the object then securely affixes the chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage,63,thor
EAGER TOWNIE,This ll do it He yells to the driver,9,thor
EAGER TOWNIE,Okay let er rip The townsfolk watch as the pick up s engine ROARS then STRAINS its wheels spinning futilely until finally the rear of the truck along with the back wheels and axles break off and go flying People dive out of the way The PICK UP DRIVER sticks his head out He is STAN THE MAN LEE He looks back shocked The townsfolk laugh the party continuing They don t notice as,74,thor
crater.,He is SHIELD AGENT COULSON He stares down at the object which glows with an otherworldly blue energy MJOLNIR He pulls out a phone,24,thor
Darcy Lewis,You know for a crazy homeless guy he s pretty cut Jane turns away Thor emerges from the back room holding a t shirt,24,thor
Darcy Lewis,Hey sorry I tased you Thor heads over to Jane s work area starts fiddling with the equipment there with interest Jane hurries over to put a stop to it,30,thor
Jane Foster,Excuse me excuse me She leads him away from the work station Thor holds up the t shirt On the front it bear a sticker which reads HELLO MY NAME IS DR DONALD BLAKE Thor looks at it puzzled Jane rips the sticker off,44,thor
Jane Foster,My ex Thor stares at her a beat,8,thor
Jane Foster,They re the only clothes I had that ll fit you Sorry,12,thor
Thor,They will suffice Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on the wall,16,thor
Jane Foster,You re welcome Now tell me Thor studies the frame grabs with interest Jane points to his form in the Bifrost photo,22,thor
Jane Foster,What were you doing in that He glances at it dismissive,11,thor
Thor,What does anyone do in the Bifrost Everyone stares at him Selvig seems to recognize the word Jane opens her notebook quickly writes the word down Thor moves close to her eyes the notations and drawings within the book curious,40,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,The Bifrost Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close to her looking over her notations She quickly closes the book,23,thor
Jane Foster,What exactly is the Bifrost,5,thor
Jane Foster,Somebody get the mortal a Pop Tart,7,thor
Frigga,I asked him to be honest with you from the beginning There should be no secrets in a family,19,thor
Loki,So why did he lie,5,thor
Frigga,He kept the truth from you so that you would never feel different You are in every way our son Loki and we your family You must know that Loki takes this in stares at Odin,36,thor
Loki,How long will it last,5,thor
Frigga,I don t know This time is different We were unprepared,11,thor
Loki,I never get used to seeing him like this The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored,24,thor
Frigga,But he s put it off for so long now I fear Loki takes her hand She s grateful wipes tears from her eyes,24,thor
Frigga,You re a good son Loki sits there uncertain how to react uncertain how he really feels,17,thor
Frigga,We mustn t lose hope that your father will return to us And your brother Loki looks to Frigga concerned,20,thor
Loki,What hope is there for Thor,6,thor
Frigga,There s always a purpose to everything your father does Thor may yet find a way home Loki looks troubled by the revelation He rises heads for the exit when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS hurriedly approaching,39,thor
Frigga,Thor is banished The line of succession falls to you Until he awakens Asgard is yours,16,thor
Frigga,Make your father proud Loki reaches out tentatively then takes it He likes the feel of it in his hand,20,thor
Jane Foster,Now tell us exactly what happened to you last night Thor looks her in the eyes staring intrigued Jane gets flustered looks away,23,thor
Jane Foster,Maybe start with how you got inside that cloud,9,thor
Darcy Lewis,And how you could eat an entire box of Pop Tarts and still be this hungry Jane shoots her a withering look Thor downs a cup of coffee,28,thor

Loki,My friends you haven t heard I am now Ruler of Asgard,12,thor
Fandral,Where is Odin,3,thor
Loki,Father s fallen into the Odinsleep My mother fears he may never awaken again,14,thor
Sif,We would speak with her Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a look Loki notices,15,thor
Loki,She has refused to leave my father s bedside You can bring your urgent matter to me your King Sif covers quickly,22,thor
Sif,We would ask you to end Thor s banishment,9,thor
Loki,My first command can not be to undo the Allfather s last We re on the brink of war with Jotunheim Our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks not liking any of this,50,thor
Loki,All of us must stand together for the good of Asgard,11,thor
Fandral,Of course Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit Loki stares after them,16,thor

Agent Phil Coulson,This should more than compensate you for your trouble She throws the check to the ground without looking at it,20,thor
Jane Foster,I can t just pick up replacements from RadioShack I made most of that equipment myself,16,thor

complex.,Clear plastic access tubes with junction boxes lead to a translucent cube structure erected in the middle of the crater Through the glass walls of the base s command trailer we see Coulson directing TECHNICIANS busy at work Within the cube structure itself a team of SHIELD SCIENTISTS work with high tech machinery analyzing the object at the center of it all Mjolnir,63,thor
Jane Foster,That isn t a satellite crash They would have hauled the wreckage away not built a city around it Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her,30,thor

Jane Foster,Wait But Thor is already headed towards the crater,9,thor
TECHIE,Feed from the keyhole Can barely penetrate the cloud cover The Techie hikes a thumb at another monitor SQUELCHING with static It shows an SAR shot of the area laid over a terrain map,34,thor
TECHIE,Tech s barely working as it is with all the interference that thing s giving off He gestures towards the hammer He checks a computer,25,thor

Agent Phil Coulson,Who are you,3,thor

Agent Phil Coulson,One way or another we find out what we want to know We re good at that Coulson leaves the room Thor lowers his head,25,thor

Loki,You mustn t blame yourself I know that you loved him I tried to tell him so but he wouldn t listen,22,thor
Loki,The burden of the throne has fallen to me now,10,thor

Agent Phil Coulson,Uh huh You mind if we take a moment to verify his identity,13,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Certainly The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name,10,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,You can understand how a man could go off like that I mean a big faceless organization like yours coming in with their jack booted thugs and stealing private property,30,thor
Agent Phil Coulson,That doesn t explain how he managed to tear through our security Selvig shrugs,14,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Steroids He s a bit of a fitness nut,9,thor

Laufey,Tell me why I shouldn t kill you,8,thor
Loki,I ve come alone and unarmed,6,thor
Laufey,To what end,3,thor
Loki,To make you another proposition,5,thor
Loki,You re welcome,3,thor
Laufey,My men are dead and I have no Casket You are a deceiver Laufey lashes out grabs Loki around the throat but Loki calmly stands his ground,27,thor
Loki,You have no idea what I am The blueness spreads across his face as Laufey and the guards stare in shock Loki grins,23,thor
Loki,Hello Father Laufey releases him Loki s body turns back to normal Intrigued Laufey sizes up his son,18,thor
Laufey,Ah the bastard son I thought Odin had killed you That s what I would have done He s as weak as you are,24,thor
Loki,No longer weak I now rule Asgard until Odin awakens Perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me This gives Laufey pause,23,thor
Laufey,Or perhaps it was the wisest choice I ve ever made I will hear you,15,thor
Loki,I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers lead you into his chambers and let you slay him where he lies I ll keep the throne and you will have the Casket Laufey studies Loki s face,39,thor
Laufey,Why would you do this,5,thor
Loki,When all is done we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds Then I the bastard son will have accomplished what Odin and Thor never could,28,thor
Laufey,This is a great day for Jotunheim Asgard is finally ours,11,thor
Loki,No Asgard is mine The rest of the Nine Realms will be yours if you do as you re told Laufey considers the proposition,24,thor
Laufey,I accept Loki turns to leave As he goes the slightest trace of a smile crosses his face,18,thor
Loki,What troubles you Gatekeeper,4,thor
Heimdall,I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim but could neither see nor hear you You were shrouded from me like the Frost Giants who entered this Realm,28,thor
Loki,Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service,11,thor
Heimdall,Or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see Loki sizes him up smiles,23,thor
Loki,You have great power Heimdall Tell me did Odin ever fear you,12,thor
Heimdall,No,1,thor
Loki,And why is that,4,thor
Heimdall,Because he is my King and I am sworn to obey him,12,thor
Loki,Exactly Just as you re sworn to obey me now Yes A beat,13,thor
Heimdall,Yes,1,thor
Loki,Good Then you will open the Bifrost to no one until I have undone what my brother has started Loki heads out of the Observatory Heimdall stares after him,29,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Seems Darcy s a terrible intern but a talented hacker,10,thor
Thor,Thank you for what you ve done,7,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Don t thank me I only did it for Jane,10,thor
Thor,Are you in love with her,6,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Of course not Jane s like a daughter to me Her father and I taught at University together A good man but he never listened This registers with Thor,29,thor
Thor,Neither did I Selvig eyes him with interest,8,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,I don t know if you re really delusional and I really don t care at this point I just care about her I ve seen the way she looks at you,32,thor
Thor,I swear to you I mean her no harm,9,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Good If that s the case then I ll buy you one more drink and you ll leave town tonight A long pause then Thor nods He takes a drink,30,thor
Thor,I had it all backwards I had it all wrong Selvig watches him keenly This is a different Thor than he s seen before,24,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,It s not a bad thing finding out that you don t have all the answers That s when you start asking the right questions Thor takes this in,29,thor
Thor,For the first time in my life I have no idea what I m supposed to do,17,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Anyone who s ever going to find their way in this world has to start by admitting they don t know where the hell they are Thor nods,28,thor
DRUNK TOWNIE,Hey I know you man An intimidating DRUNK TOWNIE nearby sizes up Thor He is one of the Townies from Isabela s Diner who saw Thor earlier He approaches belligerent and looking for a fight,35,thor
DRUNK TOWNIE,You were in the diner with that hot girl Thor doesn t like where this is going,17,thor
DRUNK TOWNIE,I wouldn t mind her doing a little research on me He laughs Thor is annoyed,16,thor
Thor,I have no quarrel with you But she s a lady You should be more respectful,16,thor
DRUNK TOWNIE,And you should shut the hell up princess Selvig looks to Thor concerned that he s going to lose it But to his surprise Thor remains unaffected by the Townie s baiting,32,thor
Thor,I will not fight him,5,thor
DRUNK TOWNIE,Then it ll be easy to kick your ass Selvig stands steps between the two men,16,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Gentlemen please Let s keep our heads Just then Selvig HEAD BUTTS the Townie knocking him out Thor s impressed Selvig downs his drink then hurls his glass aside SHATTERING it on the ground,34,thor
Thor,Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his shoulder,10,thor
Jane Foster,Erik,1,thor
Thor,He s fine Not injured at all,7,thor
Thor,Sorry my friend,3,thor
Jane Foster,What happened,2,thor
Thor,We drank We fought He made his ancestors proud,9,thor
Jane Foster,Put him on the bed Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig like a bear lugging another bear smashing into things along the way until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane s bed Selvig awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes,46,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,I still don t believe you re the God of Thunder,11,thor
Thor,These are your chambers Jane suddenly becomes self conscious She starts cleaning up the mess around her,17,thor
Jane Foster,Well it s more of a temporary living space really I don t usually have visitors in here Actually never Thor picks up a sock off the floor She snatches it from him puts it away,36,thor
Jane Foster,Can we go outside,4,thor
Jane Foster,I come up here sometimes when I can t sleep Or when I m trying to reconcile particle data Or when Darcy s driving me crazy,26,thor
Jane Foster,I m glad you re safe,6,thor
Thor,You ve been very kind I ve been far less grateful than you deserve,14,thor
Jane Foster,I also hit you with my car a couple times so it kind of evens out He grins then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her,27,thor
Jane Foster,I don t believe it She takes it from him surprised and grateful,13,thor
Thor,It was all I could get back Not as much as I promised I m sorry,16,thor
Jane Foster,No this is good Thank you This means I don t have to start from scratch She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly then stops a harsh realization clouding her face Thor notices,34,thor
Thor,What s wrong,3,thor
Jane Foster,SHIELD whatever they are They re never going to let this research see the light of day,17,thor
Thor,You must do this You must finish what you ve started,11,thor
Jane Foster,Why,1,thor
Thor,Because you re right It s taken so many generations for your people to get to this point You re nearly there You just need someone to show you how close you really are,34,thor
Thor,Look your ancestors called it magic You call it science I come from a place where they re one and the same thing We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil as she looks on amazed and intrigued,40,thor
Jane Foster,What is it,3,thor
Thor,This is how my father explained it to me,9,thor
Fandral,Our dearest friend banished Loki on the throne Asgard on the brink of war yet you manage to consume four wild boar six pheasant a side of beef and two casks of ale Shame on you Don t you care Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire but Volstagg pulls his weapon stopping him,56,thor
Volstagg,Do not mistake my appetite for apathy,7,thor
Sif,Stop it both of you We all know what we have to do we re just too damned afraid to do it,22,thor
Fandral,It s treason Hogun,4,thor
Volstagg,To hell with treason it s suicide,7,thor
Fandral,Yes yes we know,4,thor
Sif,Thor would do the same for us An EINHERJAR GUARD enters They tense,13,thor
EINHERJAR GUARD,Heimdall demands your presence Volstagg quickly drains his flagon of ale,11,thor
Volstagg,We re doomed,3,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,I need some coffee The three head inside Smith Motors,10,thor
Darcy Lewis,Thanks,1,thor
Thor,You re very welcome Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their breakfast looking like a little family,34,thor
Agent Garrett,They want an update,4,thor

Thor,To replace the one I broke Please forgive my behavior,10,thor
Isabel,Okay Thank you,3,thor
Thor,If I may I d like to come back for more of your coffee,14,thor
Isabel,Any time He nods and walks away,7,thor
Isabel,She could do worse,4,thor
Volstagg,Good Heimdall less us explain,5,thor
Heimdall,You would defy the commands of Loki our King break every oath you have taken as warriors and commit treason to bring Thor back The four exchange nervous glances,29,thor
Sif,Yes but,2,thor
Heimdall,Good The group looks puzzled What did he just say,10,thor
Volstagg,So you ll help us,5,thor
Heimdall,I am bound by honor to our King I cannot open the Bifrost to you With that Heimdall leaves them alone in the Observatory The others exchange puzzled looks,29,thor
Fandral,Complicated fellow isn t he,5,thor
Volstagg,Now what do we do Sif glances at the control panel notices something,13,thor
Sif,Look The others turn to see HEIMDALL S SWORD stuck into the control panel They exchange a grin They have an ally Sif hits the controls and the Bifrost apparatus fires up,32,thor
Agent Phil Coulson,What the hell was that,5,thor
TECHIE,I don t know sir We got massive energy readings out of nowhere then they just disappeared Fifteen miles due northwest,21,thor
Agent Phil Coulson,Let s go take a look,6,thor
Volstagg,He must have landed nearby It s time to put our tracking skills to work Spread out Check the sand for indentations of his boot prints,26,thor
Fandral,The winds would have blown them away by now We should look for signs of a campfire,17,thor
Sif,Or we could just start there She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the distance the only visible sign of civilization and to Hogun who has already started walking towards it Volstagg and Fandral trade looks their egos bruised,43,thor
Fandral,It s worth a look I suppose The party tromps towards the town,13,thor
Volstagg,There you go lad The boy just stares standing frozen The Asgardians head off,14,thor
Volstagg,Is it just me or does Earth look a little different to you,13,thor
Sif,It has been a thousand years,6,thor
Volstagg,Things change so fast here You leave for a millennium and it s like the whole neighborhood s gone Volstagg sniffs smells something,23,thor
Volstagg,Perhaps we should split up,5,thor
AGENT GARRETT,Is there a Renaissance Faire in town,7,thor
AGENT CALE,Call it in But before they can Volstagg rises up behind them smashes their heads together They re out,19,thor
Volstagg,Never cared for spies He starts to go then sees their bag of fast food on the ground Intrigued he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a bite He likes what he tastes,33,thor
Volstagg,Exquisite,1,thor
EINHERJAR GUARD,My liege the Warriors Three and the Lady Sif have gone missing Loki reacts He knows who s responsible,19,thor
Heimdall,Tell me Loki how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard,11,thor
Loki,You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of the Realm There are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind But I have need of them no longer now that I am King,43,thor
Heimdall,Then I need no longer obey you Heimdall raises his massive sword strides towards Loki Loki reaches out and with both hands takes hold of something invisible hovering in mid air before him As it quickly fades into view we realize what it is,44,thor
Loki,Ensure my brother does not return,6,thor
utensils away.,The door opens,3,thor
Volstagg,Found you Thor Jane Selvig and Darcy turn to see,10,thor
Thor,My friends Thor happily races over and greets his comrades Jane Selvig and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the room Jane looks concerned Selvig and Darcy eye them with wonder,31,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,I don t believe it,5,thor
Darcy Lewis,Who are they,3,thor
Volstagg,Lady Sif and the Warriors Three Surely you ve heard tales of Hogun the Grim Fandral the Dashing and I Volstagg the Svelte Selvig looks pointedly at Volstagg s massive gut,31,thor
Volstagg,Well perhaps I ve put on a little more muscle since I was here last,15,thor
Jane Foster,That would have been a thousand years ago Northern Europe,10,thor
Volstagg,Exactly Those lovely herring people They worshipped us Thor grins lays a hand on Volstagg s shoulder,17,thor
Thor,My friends I ve never been happier to see anyone But you should not have come,16,thor
Fandral,We re here to take you home Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving,15,thor
Thor,You know I can t My father is dead because of me I must remain in exile The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks,23,thor
Sif,Thor your father still lives Thor reacts to the revelation,10,thor
Agent Phil Coulson,Get somebody from Linguistics out here Just then they hear a RUMBLING overhead as the Bifrost storm ROARS in the sky above Coulson and the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover their vehicle windshields SHATTERING as the Bifrost storm grows in strength Finally the hole in the sky overhead opens and the funnel cloud EXPLODES out of it touching down onto the desert floor Coulson and the Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom,73,thor
Darcy Lewis,Was somebody else coming Just then the Bifrost funnel EXPLODES down to the ground,14,thor
Agent Phil Coulson,I don t think so But the guy doesn t tell me anything,13,thor
Agent Phil Coulson,Hello You re using unregistered weapons technology Please identify yourself We hear the HUM of the Destroyer s fiery energy power up inside,23,thor
Agent Phil Coulson,Incoming As the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover a blast of energy from the Destroyer EXPLODES a vehicle SHIELD agents return fire,22,thor
Thor,Leave this town now Get yourself and your friends to safety,11,thor
Jane Foster,What about you,3,thor
Thor,I must stay and fight The Asgardians look to Thor,10,thor
Thor,I m still a warrior and I will fight by your side,12,thor
Volstagg,You re but a mortal now You ll get yourself killed,11,thor
Fandral,Or one of us trying to protect you,8,thor
Sif,The best thing you can do is get the mortals to safety and leave the battle to us Thor looks at the townsfolk around them all oblivious to the oncoming threat,31,thor
Thor,Help me clear the streets I ll let none of these people die this day Thor Jane Selvig and Darcy start to herd the crowd of Townsfolk off the streets as the Warriors Three and Sif head across town towards the Destroyer,42,thor
Loki,Father Welcome to Asgard,4,thor
Sif,Keep him distracted She hurries off The Warriors Three continue towards the behemoth,13,thor
Fandral,What do you think The Svartalfheim Twist Kiss of the Hag Face Full of Boot Volstagg grins eagerly,18,thor
Volstagg,The Flying Mountain Hogun and Fandral groan,7,thor

Thor,Come on give me one Amidst the useless powder he finally finds one stone still intact Thor tosses the pouch aside holds the stone over the end of the iron rod,31,thor
Jane Foster,What are you doing What is that As the stone begins to glow Thor crushes it Jane looks on amazed as the glowing powder falls upon the piece of iron dissolving it heading downwards until it reaches Selvig s wound The powder heals his wound completely Thor looks down the street sees his wounded friends still lying there as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment He reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed flesh,78,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,I m really starting to like him Jane turns to Thor to find he s gone,16,thor
Thor,Go while you can,4,thor
Sif,But the others,3,thor
Thor,You can t help them now Your job is to survive She struggles to sit up,16,thor
Sif,No I will die a warrior s death Stories will be told of this day He gently takes her shield from her,22,thor
Thor,Live and tell those stories yourself At last she nods Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby Thor makes his way towards them Volstagg is barely breathing Thor tries to pull him to safety but it s no use He won t budge He rouses Hogun and Fandral,52,thor
Fandral,No We can still fight,5,thor
Thor,But not win Move Volstagg or he ll die Thor looks at them grins,14,thor
Thor,Don t worry my friends I have a plan The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and drag him away from the battlefield After they go Thor turns to back to the Destroyer then tosses Sif s shield aside He strides down the street towards the behemoth completely defenseless,50,thor
Thor,Brother for whatever I have done to wrong you whatever I have done to lead you to do this I am sorry But these people have done nothing to you They are innocents He continues towards the Destroyer,38,thor
Thor,Take my life and know I will never return to Asgard,11,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Jane no He pulls her into Smith Motors A RAVEN flies overhead watching the scene,15,thor
Jane Foster,Oh My God,3,thor
Agent Phil Coulson,Donald I don t think you ve been completely honest with me,12,thor
Darcy Lewis,So how can you speak our language,7,thor
Volstagg,Your language Ha Silly girl you re speaking ours Thor calls up to the sky,15,thor
Thor,Heimdall Open the Bifrost,4,thor
Thor,He would open it if he could I fear the worst,11,thor
Volstagg,Then we re trapped here forever,6,thor
Fandral,Then I suppose we d best start settling into our new lives He looks to Darcy turns on the charm,20,thor
Fandral,Are all earth maidens as fair as you Darcy enjoys the attention,12,thor
Darcy Lewis,No Thor shouts back up to the sky,8,thor
Thor,Heimdall,1,thor
Volstagg,Primitive Good enough for hunting small game I suppose Suddenly the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky Thor grins The mortals look on amazed Fandral turns to Darcy,28,thor
Fandral,Sorry my love These things happen,6,thor
Thor,Know this son of Coul You and I we fight for the same cause the protection of this world From this day forward count me as your ally,28,thor
Agent Phil Coulson,Not stolen Borrowed Jane shoots him a look Coulson quickly continues,11,thor
Agent Phil Coulson,You ll get your equipment back You re going to need it to continue your research which after today s events SHIELD would like to fully sponsor If that s all right with you Thor takes Jane s hand kisses it tenderly She looks at him her eyes filled with the fear that she may never see him again,59,thor
Thor,Whatever fate lies before me you are part of it He takes her in his arms kisses her passionately Thor and the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost,27,thor
Thor,Get him to the healing room Leave my brother to me,11,thor
the moment.,He forms an ICE BLADE,5,thor
Laufey,It s said you can still see and hear what transpires around you even in this state I hope it s true so that you may know your death came by the hand of Laufey He raises his blade above Odin s body when,44,thor
Loki,And your death came by the son of Odin,9,thor
Frigga,Standing behind him the sword stuck in his back She looks to Loki takes him in her arms,18,thor
Loki,I swear to you mother they will pay for what they ve done today I will end the Jotun threat now and forever He looks to Odin,27,thor
Loki,And I will make you proud Loki savors the moment but it s short lived as Thor bursts in He s thrown by the scene before him Odin safe Laufey and two Jotuns dead Frigga regarding Loki with pride and respect Stunned and delighted to see Thor Frigga beams,49,thor
Frigga,Thor She moves to Thor and hugs him but Thor s eyes remain fixed on his brother Loki looks at Mjolnir in his brother s hand,26,thor
Loki,Found its way back to you did it,8,thor
Thor,No thanks to you Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons,14,thor
Frigga,What,1,thor
Thor,Why don t you tell her How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends To kill me Frigga looks to Loki alarmed and confused,25,thor
Loki,It must have been enforcing Father s last command,9,thor
Thor,You re a talented liar brother Always have been,9,thor
Thor,Jotunheim,1,thor
Loki,All these years and no one s ever dared to use it as a weapon Thor hurries to the ice raises his hammer to SMASH through it to get to the controls frozen within Before he can Loki fires Gungnir The blast hits the ice in front of Thor blasting him back across the floor Loki steps down from the ice as Thor staggers to his feet,67,thor
Loki,You can t stop it The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart,14,thor
Thor,Why have you done this,5,thor
Loki,To do what Father never could To destroy their kind forever When he awakens he ll see the wisdom of what I ve done,24,thor
Thor,He won t You can t kill an entire race,10,thor
Loki,What is this newfound love for the Frost Giants You who would have killed them all with your bare hands,20,thor
Thor,I ve changed,3,thor
Loki,So have I Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir,11,thor
Loki,Fight me He swings Gungnir at Thor again Thor catches it in his hand rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki back towards the frozen controls Loki spins around aims Gungnir and fires a blast which immobilizes Thor in the air He hangs there suspended,59,thor
Thor,Is the throne really worth what you ve done What you would become,13,thor
Loki,I never wanted the throne I only wanted to be your equal Now fight me,15,thor
Thor,I will not fight you brother,6,thor
Loki,I am not your brother I never was,8,thor
Thor,Loki this is madness Loki grins,6,thor
Loki,Is it He FIRES Gungnir at Thor Thor dodges the blast rolls to his feet,15,thor
Loki,What happened to you on earth that turned you so soft Don t tell me it was a woman Thor doesn t answer Loki laughs realizing he s right,29,thor
Loki,It was Perhaps when we re finished here I ll pay her a little visit myself That did it Loki and Thor rush at each other They and their weapons collide The two battle Loki unleashing years of pent up rage and jealousy Thor having no choice but to defend himself,51,thor
Dr. Erik Selvig,Jane,1,thor
Jane Foster,Something s wrong,3,thor
Loki,If you care so much for the Jotuns then die with them The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor s body trying to drag him away He s nearly swallowed by the vortex when he concentrates mustering his will He reaches out his hand towards the Bifrost MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom into Thor s hand The hammer pulls him free Loki tries to fire off another blast at him but Thor takes to the air speeds towards his brother,81,thor
Loki,Thor Help me Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge sees Loki looking up at him desperately,19,thor
Loki,Please Loki s fingers start to slip Thor reaches down to grab his brother s wrist but his hand passes through Loki s Just then the REAL LOKI materializes behind him Thor whirls around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir Loki lifts Thor into the air impaled on the spear and hurls him across the bridge,59,thor
Loki,I was always more clever than you,7,thor
Thor,Yet still not clever enough With that Thor raises his hammer rising into the air summoning lightning A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir then channels outwards splitting up striking each one of the Lokis All of them dissipate into nothingness save one the real Loki who s sent flying back across the Bridge Gungnir knocked from his grasp Thor steps over to his fallen brother lying dazed on his back Loki winces prepares for the worst when Thor steps away Loki opens his eyes tries to stand but can t He looks confused then sees what the problem is Mjolnir rests atop his chest Struggle as he may Loki can t lift it off He s pinned to the ground Thor looks about him desperately at the Bifrost firing towards Jotunheim gaining in strength at the surge of energy moving through the Bridge He s at a loss of what to do Loki watches him smugly,155,thor
Loki,Look at you the Mighty Thor With all your strength what good does it do you now Thor knows Loki s right He s powerless to stop what s happening He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy feeding into the Observatory Then he gets an idea He realizes what he must do and what he must sacrifice Thor extends his hand towards Loki summoning Mjolnir The hammer goes flying to his grasp Loki looks confused,87,thor
Loki,Stop What are you doing Thor lifts the hammer again brings it down harder BOOM The crack grows bigger The Bifrost energy starts to stream out from it Loki thinks fast,31,thor
Loki,If you destroy the Bridge you ll never see her again Loki grabs Gungnir runs towards him ready to pierce Thor through the back,24,thor
Thor,Forgive me Summoning every bit of strength he has left Thor raises Mjolnir one last time drawing lightning to it from all sides and brings it down with a final terrible blow KRAKABOOM The Bifrost SHATTERS rainbow energy EXPLODING out of it Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of the blast A wave of destruction moves forward along the Bridge towards the Observatory breaking it apart as it goes The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART As Loki and Thor fall together Thor grabs hold of one end of Gungnir while Loki still clutches the other They both fall towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out from the broken Bridge They re an instant from being blasted by the destructive force of the energy carried away by the current pulverized by the debris when,141,thor
Odin,Standing on the edge of the broken Bridge awakened from the Odinsleep restored to his full strength Loki searches his father s face looking for some kind of approval some kind of redemption but all he sees is disappointment and regret Loki lets go,44,thor
Thor,No But it s too late Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy It carries him away along with the debris of the Bridge and the Observatory disappearing out of sight Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge Drained Thor falls back into his father s arms,56,thor
Odin,It is over,3,thor
Jane Foster,It s gone,3,thor
Volstagg,and then with a mighty bellow I flew at the great metal beast and laid it low,17,thor
Fandral,Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge a,12,thor
Volstagg,As a matter of fact falling down was a tactic Lulling the Destroyer into a false sense of security,19,thor
Fandral,Well I was the one who had to drag your enormous carcass off the battlefield That makes me the real hero Doesn t it Hogun Hogun points to Volstagg,29,thor
Hogun,Big stomach Big mouth The other gathered Asgardians laugh Volstagg and Fandral look to Hogun The grim warrior gives just a trace of a smile,25,thor
Fandral,Well how about that A smile I d say that calls for another drink They laugh and raise another round Frigga sits nearby lost in thought her face betraying the sadness she struggles to conceal Sif notices approaches Frigga bows her head,42,thor
Sif,My Queen I am so sorry for your loss Frigga takes Sif s hand appreciatively,15,thor
Frigga,Thank you Sif She looks to Thor who s unable to enjoy the merriment around him,16,thor
Frigga,How is he,3,thor
Sif,He mourns for his brother And he misses her The mortal Frigga sees the trace of regret in Sif s face as she looks at Thor with new feelings He rises and leaves the hall,35,thor
Frigga,He will need his friends now more than ever,9,thor
Sif,I will always be at his side Frigga understands puts her arm around Sif gratefully,15,thor
Odin,You ll be a wise King,6,thor
Thor,There will never be a wiser king than you Or a better father,13,thor
Odin,You ve already made me proud Odin leaves Thor consoled by his words,13,thor
Thor,Can you see her Heimdall turns gazes out towards Earth,10,thor
Heimdall,Yes,1,thor
Thor,How is she,3,thor
Darcy Lewis,Here you go,3,thor
Jane Foster,Thanks Jane inserts the flash drive into the device,9,thor
Darcy Lewis,He would have come back if he could,8,thor
Jane Foster,I know But if he can t get here on his own Jane hits a switch on the device Suddenly a D HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device bathing the two women in its glow We recognize what it is YGGDRASIL in all its beauty,47,thor
Jane Foster,maybe we can help him find his way back,9,thor
Odin,Long before the birth of light there was darkness and from that darkness came the Dark Elves Millennia ago the most ruthless of their kind Malekith sought to transform our universe back into one of eternal night,37,thor_dark_world
Odin,Such evil was possible through the power of the Aether an ancient force of infinite destruction,16,thor_dark_world
Odin,The noble armies of Asgard led by my father King Bor waged a mighty war against these creatures,18,thor_dark_world
Kurse,Malekith Asgard s forces are upon us,7,thor_dark_world
Malekith,Send the Kursed,3,thor_dark_world
Odin,As the Nine Worlds converged above him Malekith could at last unleash the Aether,14,thor_dark_world
Odin,But Asgard ripped the weapon from his grasp Without it the Dark Elves fell With the battle all but lost Malekith sacrificed his own people in a desperate attempt to lay waste to Asgard s army,36,thor_dark_world
Malekith,Their deaths will mean our survival This war is far from over,12,thor_dark_world
Odin,Malekith was vanquished and the Aether was no more Or so we were led to believe,16,thor_dark_world
Asgardian Einherjar,Sire the Aether Shall we destroy it,7,thor_dark_world
Bor,If only we could But its power is too great Bury it deep Somewhere no one will ever find it,20,thor_dark_world
Frigga,Loki,1,thor_dark_world
Loki,Hello mother Have I made you proud,7,thor_dark_world
Frigga,Please don t make this worse,6,thor_dark_world
Loki,Define worse,2,thor_dark_world
Odin,Enough I will speak to the prisoner alone,8,thor_dark_world
Loki,I really don t see what all the fuss is about,11,thor_dark_world
Odin,Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes Wherever you go there is war ruin and death,19,thor_dark_world
Loki,I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent god Just like you,18,thor_dark_world
Odin,We are not gods We are born we live we die Just as humans do,15,thor_dark_world
Loki,Give or take years,4,thor_dark_world
Odin,All this because Loki desires a throne,7,thor_dark_world
Loki,It is my birthright,4,thor_dark_world
Odin,Your birthright was to die as a child Cast out onto a frozen rock If I had not taken you in you would not be here now to hate me,30,thor_dark_world
Loki,If I am for the axe then for mercy s sake just swing it It s not that I don t love our little talks it s just I don t love them,33,thor_dark_world
Odin,Frigga is the only reason you are still alive and you will never see her again You will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons,27,thor_dark_world
Loki,And what of Thor You ll make that witless oaf king while I rot in chains,16,thor_dark_world
Odin,Thor must strife to undo the damage you have done He will bring order to the nine realms and then yes He will be king,25,thor_dark_world
Sif,I ve got this completely under control,7,thor_dark_world
Thor,Is that why everything is on fire,7,thor_dark_world
Sif,You re welcome All yours,5,thor_dark_world
Thor,Hello I accept your surrender,5,thor_dark_world
Thor,Anyone else,2,thor_dark_world
Fandral,Perhaps next time we should start with the big one,10,thor_dark_world
Guard,Keep moving Come on Keep moving Go ahead of me Don t you turn around,15,thor_dark_world
Hogun,Where do we go next,5,thor_dark_world
Thor,Hogun the peace is nearly won across the Nine Realms You should stay here Be with your people where your heart is Asgard can wait,25,thor_dark_world
Hogun,You have my thanks,4,thor_dark_world
Thor,As you have mine Heimdall when you re ready,9,thor_dark_world
Odin,Is Vanaheim secure,3,thor_dark_world
Thor,As are Nornheim and Ria Though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore,18,thor_dark_world
Odin,You must think I m a piece of bread that needs to be buttered so heavily,16,thor_dark_world
Thor,That was not my intent,5,thor_dark_world
Odin,For the first time since the Bifrost was destroyed the Nine Realms are at peace They re well reminded of our strength and you have earned their respect and my gratitude,31,thor_dark_world
Thor,Thank you,2,thor_dark_world
Odin,Nothing out of order except your confused and distracted heart,10,thor_dark_world
Thor,This isn t about Jane Foster Father,7,thor_dark_world
Odin,Human lives are fleeting they are nothing You d be better served by what lies in front of you I m telling you this not as the all father but as your father You are ready The time has come for you to take the throne Embrace and celebrate what you ve won Join your warriors Eat and drink revel in their celebration At least pretend to enjoy yourself,69,thor_dark_world
Sif,There was a time you would celebrate for weeks,9,thor_dark_world
Thor,I remember you celebrated the battle of Haragon so much that you nearly started a second,16,thor_dark_world
Sif,Well the first was so much fun,7,thor_dark_world
Sif,Take a drink with me Surely the All Father could have no further task for you tonight,17,thor_dark_world
Thor,No this is one I set myself,7,thor_dark_world
Sif,It has not gone unnoticed that you disappear each night There are Nine Realms Future king of Asgard must focus on more than one,24,thor_dark_world
Thor,I thank you for your sword and for your counsel good Lady Sif,13,thor_dark_world

Jane Foster,What are you doing,4,thor_dark_world
Darcy Lewis,Holy shit,2,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,We have to do that again Hi,7,thor_dark_world
Heimdall,Welcome to Asgard,3,thor_dark_world
Malekith,Look at my legacy Algrim I barely remember the time before light,12,thor_dark_world
Algrim,Our survival will be your legacy,6,thor_dark_world
Malekith,The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered I will reclaim the Aether I will restore our world and I ll put an end to this poisonous world,28,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,What s that,3,thor_dark_world
Eir,Be still,2,thor_dark_world
Thor,This is not of Earth what is it,8,thor_dark_world
Asgardian Nurse,We do not know but she will not survive the amount of energy surging within her,16,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,That s a quantum field generator isn t it,9,thor_dark_world
Eir,It s a Soul Forge,5,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,Does a Soul Forge transfer molecular energy from one place to another,12,thor_dark_world
Eir,Yes,1,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,It s a quantum field generator,6,thor_dark_world
Odin,My words are mere noises to you that you ignore them completely,12,thor_dark_world
Thor,She s ill,3,thor_dark_world
Odin,She is mortal Illness is their defining trait,8,thor_dark_world
Thor,I brought here because we can help her,8,thor_dark_world
Odin,She does not belong here in Asgard anymore than a goat belongs at a banquet table,16,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,Did he just Who do you think you are,9,thor_dark_world
Odin,I m Odin King of Asgard Protector of the Nine Realms,11,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,Oh Well I m,4,thor_dark_world
Odin,I know very well who you are Jane Foster,9,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,You told your Dad about me,6,thor_dark_world
Thor,Something is within her father something I have not seen before,11,thor_dark_world
Odin,Her world has its healers their called doctors let them deal with it Guards take her back to Midgard,19,thor_dark_world
Thor,Don t touch her Jane are you alright,8,thor_dark_world
Odin,That s impossible,3,thor_dark_world
Eir,The infection it s defending her,6,thor_dark_world
Thor,No it s defending itself,5,thor_dark_world
Odin,Come with me There are relics that predate the universe itself What lies within her appears to be one of them The Nine Realms are not eternal They had a dawn as they will have a dusk But before that dawn the dark forces the Dark Elves reigned absolute and unchallenged,51,thor_dark_world
Thor,Born of eternal night the Dark Elves comes to steal away your light They were these stories mother told us as children,22,thor_dark_world
Odin,Their leader Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness it was called the Aether While the other relics often appeared as stones the Aether is fluid and ever changing It changes matter into dark matter and seeks out to host bodies drawing strength from their life force Malekith sought to use the Aether s power to return the universe to one of darkness But after eternities of blood shed my father Bor finally triumphed ushering in the peace that lasted thousands of years,84,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,What happened,2,thor_dark_world
Odin,He killed them all,4,thor_dark_world
Thor,Are you certain The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them and yet here it is,18,thor_dark_world
Odin,The Dark Elves are dead,5,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me,13,thor_dark_world
Odin,No it does not,4,thor_dark_world
Malekith,The Realms will be aligned soon,6,thor_dark_world
Malekith,You ll be the last of the Kursed,8,thor_dark_world
Algrim,Let my life be sacrificed The same as our people,10,thor_dark_world
Malekith,You will become darkness doomed to this existence until it consumes you And then no power of our enemies will stop me,22,thor_dark_world
Algrim,I ll destroy their defenses and resurrect the universe,9,thor_dark_world
Loki,Odin continues to bring me new friends How thoughtful,9,thor_dark_world
Frigga,The books I sent do they not interest you,9,thor_dark_world
Loki,Is that how I m to while away eternity reading,10,thor_dark_world
Frigga,I ve done everything in my power to make you comfortable Loki,12,thor_dark_world
Loki,Have you Does Odin share your concern Does Thor It must be so inconvenient them asking after me day and night,21,thor_dark_world
Frigga,You know full well it was your actions that brought you here,12,thor_dark_world
Loki,My actions I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life that I was born to be a king,26,thor_dark_world
Frigga,A king A true king admits his faults What of the lives you took on Earth,16,thor_dark_world
Loki,A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself,12,thor_dark_world
Frigga,Your father,2,thor_dark_world
Loki,He s not my father,5,thor_dark_world
Frigga,Then am I not your mother,6,thor_dark_world
Loki,You re not,3,thor_dark_world
Frigga,Always so perceptive about everyone but yourself,7,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,When you came for me you knew I was in trouble,11,thor_dark_world
Thor,Well Heimdall had lost sight of you you were no longer on Earth,13,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,Well how s that possible,5,thor_dark_world
Thor,I believe you were in between worlds The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil orbiting Midgard in much the way your planet orbits the sun Every five thousand years the worlds align perfectly we call this the Convergence During this time the boarders between worlds become blurred It s possible you found one of these points We are lucky that it remained open Once the worlds pass out of alignment the connection is lost,73,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,I liked the way you explained that What s gonna happen to me,13,thor_dark_world
Thor,I ll find a way to save you Jane,9,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,Your father said there was,5,thor_dark_world
Thor,My father doesn t know everything,6,thor_dark_world
Frigga,Don t let him hear you say that,8,thor_dark_world
Thor,Jane Foster please meet Frigga the Queen of Asgard my mother,11,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,Hi,1,thor_dark_world
Loki,You might want to take the stairs to the left,10,thor_dark_world
Frigga,The prisons,2,thor_dark_world
Thor,Loki,1,thor_dark_world
Frigga,Go I will look after her,6,thor_dark_world
Fandral,It s as if they resent being imprisoned,8,thor_dark_world
Volstagg,There s no pleasing some creatures,6,thor_dark_world
Thor,Return to your cells and further harm will come to you You have my word Very well you don t have my word,23,thor_dark_world
Odin,Send a squadron to the weapons vault defend it at all costs Seal the dungeon,15,thor_dark_world
Frigga,Odin,1,thor_dark_world
Odin,Frigga Go It s a skirmish nothing to fear,9,thor_dark_world
Frigga,You ve never been a very good liar,8,thor_dark_world
Odin,Take her to you chambers I ll come for you when it s safe,14,thor_dark_world
Frigga,You take care,3,thor_dark_world
Odin,Despite all I have survived my queen still worries over me,11,thor_dark_world
Frigga,It s only because I worry over you that you have survived Listen to me now I need you to do everything I ask and no questions,27,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,Yes ma am,3,thor_dark_world
Odin,Frigga,1,thor_dark_world
Frigga,Stand down creature You may still survive this,8,thor_dark_world
Malekith,I have survived worse woman,5,thor_dark_world
Frigga,Who are you,3,thor_dark_world
Malekith,I am Malekith and I would have what it is mine You have taken something child Give it back Witch Where is the Aether,24,thor_dark_world
Frigga,I ll never tell,4,thor_dark_world
Malekith,I believe you,3,thor_dark_world
Erik Selvig,The universe rotates on a five thousand year cycle and once its cycled all the worlds align Imagine imagine that this is our world and and Oh thank you And this is another world Normally they re separate but during the alignment everything is connected All Nine Realms all Nine Realms are passing through each other and gravity light and even matter is crunching from one world to the other But if this happens to us now the result would be cataclysmic My gravimetric spikes can stabilize the focal point of the Convergence This time the alignment and all the other worlds would just pass up by It s beautiful It s simple Any questions,115,thor_dark_world
Patient,Yeah Can I have my shoe back,7,thor_dark_world
Algrim,I need your strength to reclaim the Aether And when you wake up you will kill them all,18,thor_dark_world
Einherjar Lieutenant,Jane Foster You need to come with us,8,thor_dark_world
Fandral,We are still unable to restore the palace shields Our artillery cannot detect them even Heimdall cannot see them My King we are all but defenseless,26,thor_dark_world
Thor,She s your prisoner now Leave us,7,thor_dark_world
Odin,I do not wish to fight with you,8,thor_dark_world
Thor,Nor I with you but I intend to pursue Malekith,10,thor_dark_world
Odin,We possess the Aether Malekith will come to us,9,thor_dark_world
Thor,Yes and you will destroy us,6,thor_dark_world
Odin,You overestimate the power of these creatures,7,thor_dark_world
Thor,No I value our peoples lives I ll take Jane to the Dark World and draw the enemy away from Asgard When Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane it will be exposed vulnerable and I will destroy it and him,40,thor_dark_world
Odin,If you fail you risk this weapon falling into the hands of our enemies,14,thor_dark_world
Thor,The risk is far greater if we do nothing His ship could be over our heads right now and we d never even know it,25,thor_dark_world
Odin,If and when he comes his men will fall by ten thousand Asgardian blades,14,thor_dark_world
Thor,And how of our men shall fall on theirs,9,thor_dark_world
Odin,As many as are needed We will fight Until the last Asgardian breath the last drop of Asgardian blood,19,thor_dark_world
Thor,And how are you different from Malekith,7,thor_dark_world
Odin,The difference my son is that I will win,9,thor_dark_world
Darcy Lewis,Jane isn t called me back Erik isn t calling me back Stupid SHIELD isn t calling me back,19,thor_dark_world
Ian Boothby,What s SHIELD,3,thor_dark_world
Darcy Lewis,It s a secret Uh hey Erik It s Darcy again Uh Thor came back he took Jane to Asgard and um I m not sure what I m supposed to do,32,thor_dark_world
News Reporter,Something else went missing this week when Astrophysicist Dr Erik Selvig notable for his involvement in the Alien invasion in New York streaked nude across Stonehenge,26,thor_dark_world
Ian Boothby,Darcy you really need to look at this Your friend Erik what was his last name again,17,thor_dark_world
News Reporter,disrobed and began shouting at visitors at the historic site He was later taken into police custody for psychiatric evaluation The police are still refusing to confirm,27,thor_dark_world
Thor,You re not in Odin s war council,8,thor_dark_world
Heimdall,The Bifrost is closed by your father s orders No one is to come or to go We face an enemy that is invisible even to me Of what use is a guardian such as that,36,thor_dark_world
Thor,Malekith will return you know this I ll need your help,11,thor_dark_world
Heimdall,I cannot overrule my King s wishes not even for you,11,thor_dark_world
Thor,I m not asking you to The Realms need their All Father strong and unchallenged whether he is or not But he is blinded Heimdall by hatred and by grief,30,thor_dark_world
Heimdall,As are we all,4,thor_dark_world
Thor,Well I see clearly enough,5,thor_dark_world
Heimdall,The risks are too great,5,thor_dark_world
Thor,Everything that we do from here on is a risk there is no other way,15,thor_dark_world
Heimdall,What do you require of me,6,thor_dark_world
Thor,What I m about to ask of you is treason of the highest order Success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death Malekith knew the Aether was here he can sense its power If we do nothing he will come for it again but this time lay waste to all of Asgard We must move Jane off world,61,thor_dark_world
Sif,The Bifrost has been shut down and the Tesseract locked away in a vault,14,thor_dark_world
Heimdall,There are other paths off Asgard ways known only to a few,12,thor_dark_world
Thor,One actually,2,thor_dark_world
Volstagg,No,1,thor_dark_world
Loki,Thor after all this time and now you come to visit me Why Have you come to gloat To mock,20,thor_dark_world
Thor,Loki enough No more illusions,5,thor_dark_world
Loki,Now you see me brother Did she suffer,8,thor_dark_world
Thor,I did not come here to share our grief Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament,20,thor_dark_world
Loki,Go on,2,thor_dark_world
Thor,I know you seek vengeance as much as I do You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you vengeance And afterward this cell,27,thor_dark_world
Loki,You must be truly desperate to come to me for help What makes you think you can trust me,19,thor_dark_world
Thor,I don t Mother did You should know that when we fought each other in the past I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere That hope no longer exists to protect you You betray me and I will kill you,49,thor_dark_world
Loki,Hmm When do we start,5,thor_dark_world
Fandral,He will betray you,4,thor_dark_world
Thor,He will try,3,thor_dark_world
Loki,This is so unlike you brother So clandestine Are you sure you wouldn t rather just punch your way out,20,thor_dark_world
Thor,If you keep speaking I just might,7,thor_dark_world
Loki,Fine As you wish I m not even here Is this better,12,thor_dark_world
Loki,Still we could be less conspicuous Hm brother You look ravishing,11,thor_dark_world
Thor,It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form,12,thor_dark_world
Loki,Very well Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions given that you seem to like them so much Oh this is much better Woh The costume s a bit much so tight But the confidence I can feel the righteousness surging Hey you wanna have a rousing discussion about truth honor patriotism God bless Amer What You could at least furnish me with a weapon My dagger something At last a little common sense,75,thor_dark_world
Thor,And I thought you liked tricks,6,thor_dark_world
Fandral,Well what then Your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of our Einherjar who will see you coming from miles away,23,thor_dark_world

Volstagg,I will give you as much time as I can,10,thor_dark_world
Thor,Thank you my friend,4,thor_dark_world

Erik Selvig,Amplifying the weapon s impact With each additional world the power will increase exponentially The effect would be universal,19,thor_dark_world
Thor,Yes well the alignment is only temporary He must be in exactly at the right place at the right time,20,thor_dark_world
Darcy Lewis,Well how do we know where that is,8,thor_dark_world
Erik Selvig,We follow the directions This has happened before thousands of years ago and The Ancients were there to see it All the great constructions the Mayas the Chinese the Egyptians they made use of the gravitational effects of the Convergence And they left us a map Stonehenge Snowdon the Great Orme These are all coordinates taking us here,58,thor_dark_world
Ian Boothby,Greenwich,1,thor_dark_world

Jane Foster,That just means we have to keep Malekith busy for eight Okay you might wanna hold on to something,19,thor_dark_world
Darcy Lewis,That is awesome How did you do that,8,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,Well gravitational fields interact with the weak spot between worlds creating,11,thor_dark_world

Erik Selvig,Did he say anything before he left,7,thor_dark_world
Jane Foster,Yeah he had to figure some stuff out with his father He kind of committed treason on our way out,20,thor_dark_world
Erik Selvig,Oh,1,thor_dark_world
Odin,You once said there would never be a wiser King than me You were wrong The alignment has brought all the realms together Every one of them saw you offer your life to save them What can Asgard offer its new King in return,44,thor_dark_world
Thor,My life Father I cannot be King of Asgard I will protect Asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath but I cannot do so from that chair Loki for all his grave imbalance understood rule as I know I never will The brutality the sacrifice it changes you I d rather be a good man than a great King,63,thor_dark_world
Odin,Is this my son I hear or the woman he loves,11,thor_dark_world
Thor,When you speak do I never hear Mother s voice This is not for Jane Father She does not know what I came here to say Now forbid me to see her or say she can rule at my side it changes nothing,43,thor_dark_world
Odin,One son who wanted the throne too much another who will not take it Is this my legacy,18,thor_dark_world
Thor,Loki died with honor I shall try to live the same Is that not legacy enough,16,thor_dark_world
Odin,It belongs to you if you are worthy of it,10,thor_dark_world
Thor,I shall try to be,5,thor_dark_world
Odin,I cannot give you my blessing nor can I wish you good fortune,13,thor_dark_world
Thor,I know,2,thor_dark_world
Odin,If I were proud of the man my son had become even that I could not say It would speak only from my heart Go my son,27,thor_dark_world
Thor,Thank you father,3,thor_dark_world
Loki,No Thank you,3,thor_dark_world

The Collector,Woh Oh Asgardians it s an honor,7,thor_dark_world
Sif,You know why we re here,6,thor_dark_world
The Collector,Of course But if I may ask why not keep it secure in your own vault,16,thor_dark_world
Volstagg,The Tesseract is already on Asgard It s not wise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together,18,thor_dark_world
The Collector,That s very wise I can assure you it will be absolutely safe in in my collection,17,thor_dark_world
Sif,See that it is,4,thor_dark_world

Thor,Hello I accept your surrender,5,thor_dark_world
Thor,Anyone else,2,thor_dark_world
Loki,I really don t see what all the fuss is about,11,thor_dark_world
Odin,Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes Wherever you go there is war ruin and death,19,thor_dark_world
Loki,I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent God just like you,18,thor_dark_world
Odin,We are not gods We re born we live we die just as humans do,15,thor_dark_world
Loki,Give or take five thousand years,6,thor_dark_world
Odin,All this because Loki desires a throne,7,thor_dark_world
Loki,It is my birthright,4,thor_dark_world
Odin,Your birthright was to DIE As a child cast out on a frozen rock If I had not taken you in you would not be here now to hate me,30,thor_dark_world
Loki,If I m for the axe then for mercy s sake just swing it It s not that I don t like our little talks it s just I don t love them,33,thor_dark_world
Odin,Frigga is the only reason you re still alive and you will never see her again You ll spend the rest of your days in the dungeons,27,thor_dark_world
Loki,And what of Thor You ll make that witless oaf King while I rot in chains,16,thor_dark_world
Odin,Thor must strive to undo the damage you have done He will bring order to the Nine Realms and then yes he will be King,25,thor_dark_world

Thor,I am Jane,3,thor_dark_world
Jane,Where were you,3,thor_dark_world
Thor,Where were you Heimdall could not see you,8,thor_dark_world
Jane,I was right here where you left me I was waiting and then I was crying and then I went out looking for you You said you were coming back,30,thor_dark_world
Thor,I know I know but the Bifr st was destroyed The Nine Realms erupted into chaos Wars were raging marauders were pillaging I had to put an end to the slaughter,31,thor_dark_world
Jane,As excuses go it s not terrible But I saw you on TV You were in New York,18,thor_dark_world
Thor,Jane I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world but I was wrong I was a fool I believe that fate brought us together,27,thor_dark_world
Malekith,Look upon my legacy Algrim I can barely remember a time before the light,14,thor_dark_world
Algrim,Our survival will be your legacy,6,thor_dark_world
Malekith,The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered I will reclaim the Aether I will restore our world And I will put an end to this poisoned universe,28,thor_dark_world
Odin,She does not belong in Asgard any more than a goat belongs at a banquet,15,thor_dark_world
Jane,Did he just Who do you think you are,9,thor_dark_world
Odin,I am Odin King of Asgard Protector of the Nine Realms,11,thor_dark_world
Jane,Oh Well I m,4,thor_dark_world
Odin,I know very well who you are Jane Foster,9,thor_dark_world
Jane,You told your dad about me,6,thor_dark_world
Frigga,You know full well it was your actions that brought you here,12,thor_dark_world
Loki,My actions I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life that I was born to be a king,26,thor_dark_world
Frigga,A king A true king admits his faults What of the lives you took on Earth,16,thor_dark_world
Loki,A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself,12,thor_dark_world
Frigga,Your father,2,thor_dark_world
Loki,He s not my father,5,thor_dark_world
Frigga,Then am I not your mother,6,thor_dark_world
Loki,You re not,3,thor_dark_world
Frigga,You re always so perceptive about everyone but yourself,9,thor_dark_world
Frigga,Stand down creature and you may still survive this,9,thor_dark_world
Malekith,I have survived worse woman,5,thor_dark_world
Frigga,Who are you,3,thor_dark_world
Malekith,I am Malekith and I would have what is mine You have taken something child Give it back WITCH Where is the Aether,23,thor_dark_world
Frigga,I ll never tell you,5,thor_dark_world
Malekith,I believe you,3,thor_dark_world
Loki,Thor After all this time and now you come to visit me Why Have you come to gloat To mock,20,thor_dark_world
Thor,Loki enough No more illusions,5,thor_dark_world
Loki,Now you see me brother Did she suffer,8,thor_dark_world
Thor,I did not come here to share our grief Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament,20,thor_dark_world
Loki,Go on,2,thor_dark_world
Thor,I know you seek vengeance as much as I do You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you Vengeance And afterward this cell,27,thor_dark_world
Loki,You must be truly desperate to come to me for help What makes you think you can trust me,19,thor_dark_world
Thor,I don t Mother did You should know that when we fought each other in the past I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere That hope no longer exists to protect you You betray me and I will kill you,49,thor_dark_world
Loki,Hm When do we start,5,thor_dark_world
Jane,You re,2,thor_dark_world
Loki,I m Loki You may have heard,7,thor_dark_world

Loki,I like her,3,thor_dark_world
Sif,Betray him and I ll kill you,7,thor_dark_world
Loki,Good to see you too Sif,6,thor_dark_world
Volstagg,If you even think about betraying him,7,thor_dark_world
Loki,You ll kill me Evidently there will be a line,10,thor_dark_world
Loki,You know this is wonderful This a tremendous idea Let s steal the biggest most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that Flying around the city smash it into everything in sight so everyone can see us It s brilliant Thor It s truly brilliant,47,thor_dark_world
Fandral,I see your time in the dungeon has made you no less graceful Loki,14,thor_dark_world
Loki,You lied to me I m impressed,7,thor_dark_world
Loki,If it were easy everyone would do it,8,thor_dark_world
Thor,Are you mad,3,thor_dark_world
Loki,Possibly,1,thor_dark_world
Thor,You think you alone were loved of Mother You had her tricks but I had her trust,17,thor_dark_world
Loki,Trust Was that her last expression trust While you let her die,12,thor_dark_world
Thor,What good were you in your cell,7,thor_dark_world
Loki,Who put me there Who put me there,8,thor_dark_world
Thor,You know damn well You know damn well who She wouldn t want us to fight,16,thor_dark_world
Loki,Well she wouldn t exactly be shocked,7,thor_dark_world
Thor,I wish I could trust you,6,thor_dark_world
Loki,Trust my rage,3,thor_dark_world
Thor,I will tell Father what you did here today,9,thor_dark_world
Loki,I didn t do it for him,7,thor_dark_world
Darcy,What the hell was that Why are you smiling,9,thor_dark_world
Dr. Erik Selvig,There s nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are,15,thor_dark_world
Malekith,You needn t have come so far Asgardian Death would have come to you soon enough,16,thor_dark_world
Thor,Not by your hand,4,thor_dark_world
Malekith,Your universe was never meant to be Your world and your family will be EXTINGUISHED,15,thor_dark_world
Malekith,Darkness returns Asgardian Have you come to witness the end of your universe,13,thor_dark_world
Thor,I ve come to accept your surrender,7,thor_dark_world
Malekith,You think you can stop this The Aether cannot be destroyed,11,thor_dark_world
Thor,But you can,3,thor_dark_world
Odin,One son who wanted the throne too much and another who will not take it Is this my legacy,19,thor_dark_world
Thor,Loki died with honour I shall try to live the same Is that not legacy enough,16,thor_dark_world
Odin,It belongs to you if you are worthy of it,10,thor_dark_world
Thor,I shall try to be,5,thor_dark_world
Odin,I can not give you my blessing nor can I wish you good fortune,14,thor_dark_world
Thor,I know,2,thor_dark_world
Odin,If I were proud of the man my son has become even that I could not say it would speak only from my heart Go my son,27,thor_dark_world

Sif,See that it is,4,thor_dark_world
The Collector,One down five to go,5,thor_dark_world
Thor,Now I know what you re thinking Oh no Thor s in a cage How did this happen Well sometimes you have to get captured just to get a straight answer out of somebody It s a long story but basically I m a bit of a hero See I spent some time on earth fought some robots saved the planet a couple of times Then I went searching through the cosmos for some magic colorful Infinity Stone things didn t find any That s when I came across a path of death and destruction which led me all the way here into this cage where I met you,109,thor_ragnarok
Thor,How much longer do you think we ll be here,10,thor_ragnarok
Surtur,Thor Son of Odin,4,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Surtur Son of a bitch you re still alive I thought my father killed you like half a million years ago,21,thor_ragnarok
Surtur,I cannot die Not until I fulfill my destiny and lay waste to your home,15,thor_ragnarok
Thor,You know it s funny you should mention that because I ve been having these terrible dreams of late Asgard up in flames falling to ruins and you Surtur are at the center of all of them,37,thor_ragnarok
Surtur,Then you have seen Ragnarok the fall of Asgard The great prophecy,12,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Hang on Hang on,4,thor_ragnarok
Thor,I ll be back around shortly I really feel like we were connecting there,14,thor_ragnarok

Thor,I swear I m not even moving it s just doing this on its own I m really sorry Okay let me get this straight You re going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame and then you ll suddenly grow as big as a house,47,thor_ragnarok
Surtur,A mountain,2,thor_ragnarok
Thor,The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard,10,thor_ragnarok
Surtur,Odin is not on Asgard And your absence has left the throne defenseless,13,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Okay so where is it This crown,7,thor_ragnarok
Surtur,This is my Crown the source of my power,9,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Oh that s a crown I thought it was a big eyebrow,12,thor_ragnarok
Surtur,It s a crown BLUE DRAFT,6,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Anyway it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that thing off your head,19,thor_ragnarok
Surtur,But Ragnarok has already begun You cannot stop it I am Asgard s doom and so are you All will suffer all will burn,24,thor_ragnarok
Thor,That s intense To be honest seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle But it looks like I m going to have to go with option B where I bust out of these chains knock that tiara off your head and stash it away in Asgard s vault,57,thor_ragnarok
Surtur,You cannot stop Ragnarok Why fight it,7,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Because that s what heroes do,6,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Wait sorry I didn t time that right And now,10,thor_ragnarok
Surtur,You have made a grave mistake Odinson BLUE DRAFT,9,thor_ragnarok
Thor,I make grave mistakes all the time Everything seems to work out,12,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Heimdall I know it s been a while but I could use a fast exit,15,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Heimdall,1,thor_ragnarok
Skurge,Heimdall was an idiot This job should have made him rich Now the job ain t easy but it does have its benefits The Bi Frost gives me access to everything the Nine Realms have to offer I mean it s all mine for the taking Behold my stuff,49,thor_ragnarok
Skurge,I m particularly fond of these I pulled em out of a place on Midgard called Texas I even named them Des and Troy You see when you put them together they destroy,33,thor_ragnarok

Thor,Right Where s Heimdall,4,thor_ragnarok
Skurge,That traitor No one knows he s a fugitive of the throne,12,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Traitor,1,thor_ragnarok
Skurge,Yeah you see Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty but he disappeared before the trial Hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the Universe,28,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Sure,1,thor_ragnarok
Skurge,Hold on I m supposed to announce your arrival,9,thor_ragnarok

Thor,It was a wonderful joke,5,thor_ragnarok
Odin,It was indeed hilarious,4,thor_ragnarok
Thor,You are the savior of Asgard,6,thor_ragnarok

Loki,I didn t do it for him,7,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Noooooo,1,thor_ragnarok
Odin,And so Loki died of his wounds giving his life for ours He fought back those disgusting dark elves He brought peace to the realm,25,thor_ragnarok
Odin,Loki my boy Twas many moons ago I found you on a frost bitten battlefield,15,thor_ragnarok
Odin,On that day I did not yet see in you Asgard s savior No You were merely a little blue baby icicle that melted this old fool s heart,29,thor_ragnarok

Thor,You know what this is,5,thor_ragnarok
Odin,The skull of Surtur That s a formidable weapon,9,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Do me a favor Lock this in a vault so it doesn t turn into a giant monster and destroy the whole planet,23,thor_ragnarok
Odin,So it s back to Midgard for you is it,10,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Nope I ve been having this reocurring dream lately BLUE DRAFT,11,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Every night I see Asgard fall into ruins,8,thor_ragnarok
Odin,That s just a silly dream Signs of an overactive imagination,11,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Possibly but then I decide to go out there and investigate And what do I find but the Nine Realms completely in chaos Enemies of Asgard assembling plotting our demise all while you Odin the protector of those Nine Realms are sitting here in your bathrobe eating grapes,48,thor_ragnarok
Odin,Well it is best to respect our neighbors freedom,9,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Of course the freedom to be massacred,7,thor_ragnarok

Valkyrie,And suddenly you re overcome with an urge to do the right thing,13,thor_ragnarok
Loki,Heavens no I ve run out of favor with the Grandmaster,11,thor_ragnarok
Loki,And in exchange for codes and access to a ship I m asking for safe passage through the anus,19,thor_ragnarok
