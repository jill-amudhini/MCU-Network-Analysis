[The Columbia Pictures logo plays normally. At the end, the Torch Lady fades into a statue in Ixtenco, Mexico.]
[A car drives up to a destroyed village. Maria Hill and Nick Fury get out]
Agent Maria Hill: Nick, this was a tragedy, but it's not why we're here. What, are we fighting the weather now?
Nick Fury: Locals say the cyclone had a face.
Agent Maria Hill: People say things when they're under stress. Okay, that does not mean that this is the start to another big world-
[A green cloud of smoke appears in front of them. Both pull out their guns, looking towards a strangely dressed man.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Who are you?
[The Earth Elemental, that appears to be made from rocks, comes from the ground in the village.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: You don't want any part of this. [he steps forward, green blasts shooting from his hands]
[Marvel intro plays to 'I Will Always Love You' by Whitney Houston (1963 - 2012). A poorly edited video in tribute of the fallen Avengers, Tony Stark/Iron Man, Steve Rogers/Captain America (although it is unknown that he actually died.), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, and Vision plays. It shifts to show Midtown School of Science and Technology's news show, hosted by Betty Brant and Jason Ionello.]
Betty Brant: Gone. But not forgotten.
Jason Ionello: Thanks to Kenneth Lim and Vihaan Ramamurthy for their help with that touching video tribute.
Betty Brant: This year has been nothing short of-
Jason Ionello: [a beep blocks out what he said] S**t is crazy. It's like, insane.
Betty Brant: Jason.
Jason Ionello: What?
Betty Brant: No swearing.
Jason Ionello: Yeah, it's like the last day of school, we're good.
Betty Brant: Historic. Over five years ago, half of all life in the universe, including our own Midtown High was wiped from existence. But then eight months ago, a band of brave heroes brought us back. They called it the Blip. Those of us who blipped away came back the same age. But our classmates that didn't blip grew five years older.
Jason Ionello: Yeah, like my little brother is now older than me.
Betty Brant: (annoyed) Yeah, it's math. And even though we had blipped away half way through the school year and had already taken midterms, the school made us start the whole year over from the beginning.
Jason Ionello: Totally unfair. It's not right.
Betty Brant: Tigers, it's been a long, dramatic, somewhat confusing road. As we draw this year to a close, it's time to move on to a new phase of our lives.
Jason Ionello: Pray nothing crazy happens again because, are the Avengers even a thing anymore? Does anyone even have a plan?!
[In a classroom, Peter Parker sits down next to Ned Leeds.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I have a plan. (enthusiastic) Okay, first, I sit next to MJ on the flight.
Ned Leeds: Mhm.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Second, I’m gonna buy a dual headphone adapter and watch movies with her the whole time.
Ned Leeds: Okay.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Three, when we go to Venice, Venice is super famous for making stuff out of glass, right?
Ned Leeds: True.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: So, I’m gonna buy her a Black Dahlia necklace, because her favorite flower is the Black Dahlia, because of, well...
Ned Leeds: The murder.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: The murder. Four, when we go to Paris, I’m gonna take her to the top of the Eiffel Tower, give her the necklace...
Ned Leeds: Oh!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: And then five, I’m gonna tell her how I feel...And then six, hopefully she tells me she feels the same way.
Ned Leeds: Oh! Don’t forget step seven.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: [thinking] Step seven...
Ned Leeds: Don’t do any of that.
[Peter looks up, confused.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Why?
Ned Leeds: Because we’re gonna be bachelors in Europe, Peter!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Ned...
Ned Leeds: Look, I may not know much, but I do know this: Europeans love Americans.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: ...Really?
Ned Leeds: And more than half of them are women!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay, sure, but...I really like MJ, man. Okay? She’s awesome, she’s funny in a sort of dark way, and sometimes I catch her looking at me, and I like I’ve feel stood up way too...Wait. Dude, she’s coming now. Just don’t say anything.
[Michelle Jones walks over to them.]
Michelle / MJ: What up, dorks? Excited about the science trip?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hey, uh, yeah. We’re just talking about the trip.
Ned Leeds: Yeah, and Peter’s plan.
Michelle / MJ: You have a plan?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I don’t-I don't have a plan.
Ned Leeds: No, he’s just going to collect tiny spoons while we’re traveling to other countries. (winks at Peter)
Michelle / MJ: Like a grandmother?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I’m not collecting tiny spoons. He’s collecting tiny spoons.
Michelle / MJ: Oh. Okay, well...that was a real roller coaster.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Mhm...
Michelle / MJ: By the way, travel tip: You should probably download a VPN on your phone, just so that the government can’t track you while we’re abroad.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Smart. Will do.
[MJ leaves.]
Ned Leeds: Dude, I think that went really great!
[Peter seems to disagree.]
[In the Homeless Support building, Spider-Man (in his Iron Spider suit) and his Aunt May are on stage.]
May Parker: When I blipped back to my apartment, the family living there was very confused. The wife thought that I was a mistress. (the audience laughs) The Grandma thought that I was a ghost. (more laughter) It was, (laughs) it was really a mess. Thank you all for coming out to support those who have been displaced by the Blip, and, of course, thanks to our very own Spider-Man!
[The audience erupts in applause for Spider-Man. Aunt May gestures Peter to the microphone.]
Spider-Man: Thank you, Ms. Parker, for having me. And thank you guys for having me. [Awkwardly gives the audience a thumbs-up.]
[The audience cheers once more.]
May Parker: And thank you Spider-Man, and he’ll be right back out to take photos and videos, thank you!
[Peter and Aunt May head backstage. Peter unmasks himself.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: That was amazing.
May Parker: That was great. (high-fives Peter)
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Ah, that was so cool. I was a little nervous!
May Parker: My body was a little stiff, I felt like I wasn’t in the pocket.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, I thought you did great!
May Parker: Yeah, well, actually, I did think you were a little stiff.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: [shrugs] I felt that, too, I felt that, too.
May Parker: It’s fine, it’s fine, it’s fine. Did you get your passport?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah.
May Parker: Mini toothpaste?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah.
[Happy Hogan enters. He’s carrying a big check for the homeless.]
Happy Hogan: Hey, sorry I’m late.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Happy, hey!
Happy Hogan: [to May] Oh, you look lovely.
May Parker: Thanks, you too.
Happy Hogan: Thank you. New dress?
May Parker: Uh, yeah. Yes, it is. That’s a new beard.
[Peter looks back in forth between the two, confused.]
Happy Hogan: It’s my Blip beard, because I grew it in the blip. Blip beard.
May Parker: I see.
Happy: Anyway, the reason I'm late is because this was misplaced at the office. Can you believe it? Because it's enormous. I mean, not the amount, the size. The amount's nice too.
May Parker: (laughs) Oh.
Happy Hogan: The very generous Pepper Potts, said...
May Parker: Thank you.
Happy Hogan: ...she’s sorry she couldn’t be here.
[Peter is still looking at them in confusion]
May Parker: I think I’m going to go change the Sterno under the vegan lasagna. (to Peter) Spider-Man, go shake hands.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Will do. [turns to Happy as May leaves] What just happened?
Happy Hogan: Heads up, Nick Fury's calling you.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Nick Fury’s going to call me?
Happy Hogan: Yeah.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Why?
Happy Hogan: Why? Because he probably has some hero stuff for you to do. You’re a superhero. He calls superheroes.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Well, I mean if it was really that important, he’d probably call someone else. Not me.
[inside Peter’s bag, his phone begins to ring]
Happy Hogan: Apparently not. [Peter pulls out his phone from the bag] No caller ID. That’s him.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I don’t really want to talk to Nick Fury.
Happy Hogan: Answer the phone.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Why?
Happy Hogan: Because if you don’t talk to him, then I have to talk, and I don’t want to talk to him.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Why don’t you want to talk to him?
Happy Hogan: Because I’m scared. Just answer the phone! [Peter holds up his phone, and declines the call] You sent Nick Fury to voice mail?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah.
Happy Hogan: You don’t send Nick Fury to voice mail!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Did you hear that? They’re calling me. I got to go. I got to go.
[Peter starts to back away]
Happy Hogan: You got to talk to him.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I’m going to call him. I promise you. I’m going to call him. I will.
Happy Hogan: You do not ghost Nick Fury!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I promise you, I’ll call him. [Peter backs out of the room through the curtains, and whispers to himself] After my trip.
[Peter puts his iron-mask on as he backs away and turns around to open the curtain. He jumps up as he enters the stage]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hey! [waves]
[From the other room, Happy gets buzzed. He puts his phone up to his ear.]
Happy Hogan: Yeah? Hi -- No, no, he's not ghosting you.
[FROM THE STAGE]
[Reporters crowd all around Peter as he just entered. The crowd is speaking indistinctly. Peter backs away, putting a hand up, so they could stay back.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay, one question at a time.
[Peter points to the Asian woman.]
Woman: Are you the head Avenger? Are you the head Avenger now?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Uh, no I'm not.
[He points to another woman, who leans over the crowd of reporters.]
Woman: If the aliens come back, what are you gonna do?
[Peter looks around.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Does anyone have any neighborhood questions?
[Everyone starts asking desperately. He leans in for a man to ask a question, hoping it's a neighborhood question.]
Sean: Sean Wilford, Queens Tribune. What is it like to take over from Tony Stark? Those are some big shoes to fill.
[His question echoes Peter's mind. Everyone's still asking questions as he has time to think of his answer. He started to have anxiety and feels like he is about to pass out.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I'm uh-- I'm going to go. Thanks so much, everyone, for coming.
[He jumps up to the roof, to only find himself on top, looking out onto the city. His mask fades off and he breathes deeply as a large train passes by. A cellphone buzzes in his backpack and he reaches to get it. He never answers and the buzzing stops as he looks back into the city. He turns to his left to see a painting of Iron-Man coming right at him. He blinks as he turns away, feeling the pain and sorrow as he thinks about his long-lost friend.]
[PETER'S ROOM]
[An unknown phone number shows up on Peter's cracked phone as he packs his suitcase. He looks at it, but he sets it back down, upset. He pulls a bin from underneath the bed and takes some clothes out and sniffs them as he places it in his suitcase. He gets up, exhausted.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay.
[He stays there for a moment before he turns his head to see his old Spider-Man suit, hanging from his closet. He looks at it. He closes the closet. Suddenly, May Parker comes in with an banana in her hand.]
May Parker: Hungry?
[She throws the banana at Peter's shoulder. It hits him and he jerks back, petrified. He gasps as he turns around to see May with her hands on her mouth, shocked.]
May Parker: Oh... So sorry. Ha-ha. I thought you could sense that with your Peter-tingle.
[She points at him with a smile. He sighs, exhausted at that nickname.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Please do not start calling it Peter-tingle.
May Parker: So what's up? You can dodge bullets but not bananas?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, I just really need this vacation. I need a break.
[May Parker comes to wrap her arms around Peter's neck. She hugs him.]
May Parker: You deserve it.
[She rubs his shoulders as she pulls away.]
May Parker: Yeah. [Turns around] You know what? You should pack your suit, just in case. I have a tingle about it.
[Aunt May smirks as she walks away. Peter cringes.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Please stop saying "tingle," May.
[He looks over at his suit.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No. [he closes the closet door]
[He looks over at his new suit that is in a cage. It looks like magic floating around it and a sign behind it says 'Iron Spider Charging Do Not Unplug.' His hand is still on the closet door as he looks at it in deep thought.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No. No, I'm not.
[He closes his suitcase.]
[AIRPLANE]
As the airplane flies by, we see Peter opening his window and looking out at the view. He smiles happily.
Ned taps him on the shoulder, excitedly.
Ned Leeds: Yeah!
Man 1: Can you help me get my stuff up?
Woman 1: Oh, sorry, that's mine.
Man 2: No worries.
[Betty Brant comes in, waving at some people. Mr. Harrington comes behind her, looking around the place.]
Mr. Harrington: Do you want the first shift or the second? I could take either.
Mr. Dell: Give me the third shift. I took an Ambien.
Mr. Harrington: I can't chaperone these kids alone.
[Suddenly, a familiar voice can be heard from the other side of the plane. It's Flash Thompson. He held a drink in his hand.]
Flash Thompson: Yo, Parker! This, is called an airplane. It's like the buses you're used to, [MJ walks by] except it flies over the poor neighborhoods instead of driving through them.
[MJ leans over to the flight attendant. Brad Davis is with her.]
Michelle / MJ: Ma'am?
Flight Attendant: Mm-hm?
Michelle / MJ: He blipped, so technically, he's 16, not 21.
[Flash Thompson blinks at MJ as the flight attendant reaches to grab his drink out of his hand. He looks down as she grabs it.]
Flight Attendant: I'll take that.
[People start to laugh as Flash Thompson's eyes grow big. He turns to her.]
Flash Thompson: She's lying! I don't even know this girl.
[MJ turns around to the boys that are sitting there as Flash Thompson leaves. She looks at them and lifts her chin up in a 'hi' kind of way. Brad Davis smiles at them as he passes by.]
Brad Davis: Classic MJ, right?
[Peter Parker looks over at Brad Davis with a creeped out expression as Ned Leeds sits there with a cool one. He turns his head as Peter Parker starts talking.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Did you know Brad was coming?
[Ned Leeds shakes his head.]
Ned Leeds: It-- It's so weird. Like, one day, he's that kid who cried and got nosebleeds all the time, and suddenly, we Blip back, and he's totally ripped and super nice and all these girls are after him.
[Peter Parker narrows his eyebrows as they turn back around from watching Brad Davis and MJ put their stuff in the overhead compartments.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Not all the girls are after him.
Ned Leeds: No, man. They're all after him.
[MJ and Brad Davis are helping each other out.]
MJ [giggling]: Yeah. Here.
[Ned Leeds turns back around.]
Ned Leeds: Anyway, on to more important things. [He unzips his bag. He shows Peter Parker what he has.] It's a nine-hour flight. We can play Beast Slayers the whole time.
[Peter Parker looks back at MJ, staring at her for a split second before leaned into Ned's ear to whisper.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I need your help to sit next to MJ.
[Ned Leeds rolls his eyes as he sighs. Peter looks back at MJ again.]
Ned Leeds: Seriously?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yes, seriously.
Ned Leeds: What about all our plan? American bachelors in Europe!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: That's your plan! That's a solo plan. Come on, this is my plan.
[Ned Leeds looks at him with solemn eyes. He turns around and back again. Peter Parker looks desperately at him.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Please.
[Ned rolls his eyes as his head leans back.]
[Ned Leeds gets up from his seat over to MJ and Betty Brant, who are sitting next to each other. They look up at him.]
Ned Leeds: Hey, guys. Uh, there's an old lady in front of us wearing a crazy amount of perfume and it's kind of setting off Peter's allergies. Uh, Betty, if you could switch seats with him, that would be--
Betty Brant: He's allergic to perfume?
[Ned Leeds stays silent and shakes his head.]
Ned Leeds: Yeah, yeah, because it-- it makes his eyes water, and he can't really--
Mr. Harrington turns around in his seat after eavesdropping on the conversation.
Mr. Harrington: Peter has a perfume allergy?
Ned Leeds: Oh, uh...
Mr. Harrington: From experience, perfume allergies are no joke. I can feel hives breaking out already. MJ, stand up.
[Mr. Harrington gets up from his seat as Peter Parker does.] [MJ stands up as Mr. Harrington gives orders.]
Mr. Harrington: Ned, take MJ's spot. MJ, you take my spot. [Mr. Harrington turns toward Peter] Peter, let's get you out of there.
Michelle / MJ: Sorry.
Mr. Harrington: Zach and Sebastian, you take Ned and Peter's seats.
Brad Davis: That's all right.
Mr. Harrington: Ned, thanks for bringing this to my attention. Your safety is my responsibility and Mr. Dell's, but he's... [Mr. Dell can be seen snoring] I got it for now. Let's go, Peter!
[Peter Parker looks at Mr. Harrington like he's gone bonkers and picks up his bag.]
Mr. Harrington: Let's go!
[Peter Parker moves to his spot.] [Ned Leeds sits down next to Betty Brant, who looks depressed.]
[Peter Parker passed by Mr. Harrington and sat down at the spot next to him.]
Mr. Harrington: Yeah, I have a small bladder, so I took the aisle.
[Ned Leeds turns around to Betty Brant.]
Ned Leeds: So did you want to play Beast Slayer?
Betty Brant: Nope.
[Awkward silence.]
Ned Leeds: Have you ever played any kind of PC game or--?
Betty Brant: No.
Ned Leeds: [Nods] Got it.
[Peter Parker is in the back with Mr. Harrington, looking upset as the teacher is telling a story.]
Mr. Harrington: Did I ever tell you how my wife pretended to Blip out?
[Peter Parker doesn't answer.]
Mr. Harrington: Turns out, she ran off with a guy in her hiking group. We had a fake funeral for her and everything. Well, the funeral was real because I thought she was really dead. Wanna see the video?
Brad Davis: Well, I've gotta dual headphone adapter if you wanna watch a movie.
Michelle / MJ: Only if it's depressing, or hilarious.
Mr. Harrington: [To Peter Parker] Oh you have a dual headphone adapter. We can watch together.
Pilot: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, this is your Captain speaking. Flight time today will be eight hours and forty-nine minutes to Venice, Italy.
[AIRPORT - VENICE, ITALY]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hey, man. Did you see Brad and MJ on the plane? They were watching movies and laughing the entire time.
Ned Leeds: Dude, don’t worry, okay? I’m sure it’s nothing.
Betty Brant: Hey, babe, can you hold this for me, please?
Ned Leeds: Yeah, of course
Betty Brant: Thanks
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What was that?
Ned Leeds: Well, we actually got to talking on the plane, and it turns out we have a lot in common. So, uh, we’re boyfriend-girlfriend now.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Whatever happened to being an American bachelor in Europe?
Ned Leeds: Peter... those were the words of a boy. That boy met a woman. A very strong and powerful woman. And now, that boy’s a man.
Betty Brant: Babe?
Ned Leeds: Coming, babe.
[Through customs, Peter Parker is taken away from the group into a private searching area. A stern-looking woman places the case on a table, and unzips it.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: There’s nothing in there, I swear
[The case is opened and reveals — Peter’s Spider-Man suit. There’s a yellow sticky-note taped to it saying “You almost forgot this — May xx”. The woman picks up the banana placed next to it.]
Attendant: This, no. [holds up banana]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Sorry.
[Peter Parker has now rushed back to the school group.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I’m here! Mr. Harrington! I'm here, I'm here!
Mr. Harrington: Wait, wait, wait, Peter’s here. Thank goodness.
[The school group took a boat through the Grand Canale in Venice. They group is touristy, taking photos and videos of Venice.]
[Their boat pulls up to the most dingy-looking hotel in the area. With scaffolding covering the front, the ‘hotel’ sign hanging ’by a thread’.]
Mr. Harrington: Looks like we’re here. They're doing some renovations to the place. Getting some upgrades.
Student: This place is trash
Mr. Harrington: That must be the concierge.
[INSIDE HOTEL]
Mr. Harrington: Everyone, here we are! [He takes in the desolate insides of the hotel — it’s just as bad as the outside, maybe even worse. A cat standing on a table meows. Mr. Harrington steps into a puddle of water]
Mr. Dell: Oh whoa... whoa, whoa.
Michelle / MJ: Tell me we’re not staying here.
Flash Thompson: This place is sinking.
Mr. Harrington: [with feigned enthusiasm] I think you mean charming!
Mr. Dell: Okay everybody. Drop your bags off and we’re gonna meet at the Da Vinci museum at 3. Let's go!
Me Harrington: Vamanos!
Michelle / MJ: It’s andiamo.
Mr. Harrington: Andiamo!
Mr. Dell [to the students]: When in Rome, you do as Romans do. When you’re in Venice, your socks get wet!
[Students grumbling]
[Students are now at the Saint Marco Polo’s Square.]
Flash Thompson: What’s up, Flash Mob, how are you guys doing? I’m in Saint Marco Polo’s [Someone — probably a student — runs past and hits Flash in the groin. Flash doubles over.] — Oh!
[Ned Leeds and Betty Brant are getting a caricature drawing done of them.]
Betty Brant: This is so much fun!
Ned Leeds: Yeah? [chuckles awkwardly]
[Mr. Harrison is trying to take a photo of himself in front of the scenery. He sets his camera on the railing and posed awkwardly. The camera beeps and takes the picture. Grabbing the camera, Mr. Harrison nearly drops it. He looks at the picture and the camera slips from his hands, falling into the water.]
[Students are taking a photo in front of a touristy thing]
Student: Three, two, one, say ‘pizza!’
Other students: Pizza!
[MJ is standing with her arms out, pigeons perched on her arm and shoulder while Brad takes her picture.]
[Away from the crowd, Peter Parker enters a small shop.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Buongiorno.
Shopkeeper: Buongiorno.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hi, Uh, I’m looking for a, uh...
~CUT TO THE NECKLACE BEING COMPLETED~
Shopkeeper: Fiore Nero [he holds the black dahlia necklace up to the light]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: It’s perfect.
[Peter Parker has exited the shop and joined the fray of tourists and locals in Venice. He’s smiling to himself as he holds the bag. MJ comes up unexpectedly behind him.]
Michelle / MJ: Boh!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What?
Michelle / MJ: Boh. It’s the most perfect word in the world. Italians created it, and I just discovered it.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What does it mean?
Michelle / MJ: That’s the thing, it can mean a million things. It can mean ‘I don’t know’, ‘get out of my face’, ‘I don’t know and get out of my face’. It’s the best thing Italy ever created, except for maybe espresso.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Oh, so you’ve been drinking espresso.
[An Italian man comes up to them, holding a rose, gesturing between the pair.]
Man: German? American?
Michelle / MJ: Boh
[The man frowns and walks off.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Whoa.
Michelle / MJ: Boh is my new superpower. It’s like the anti aloha. I was born to say this word... So, what’s in the bag?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Oh, uh.... Boh.
Michelle / MJ: Nice.
[MJ notices the many crabs escaping the water by drawing up the pillars at one of the many docks. She pulls out her phone to take a picture.]
Michelle / MJ: Whoa, cool.
[Peter Parker notices the water being sucked into a grate.]
[Waves rock the boat where Ned Leeds and Betty Brant are comparing hands and smiling at each other.]
Betty Brant: What was that?
[The waves continue before the water becomes still for a split second. Water erupts from the canal and people scream.]
[Ned and Betty scream as their boat is pushed towards shore by the waves.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Betty! You okay?
[Peter Parker helps Betty Brant and Ned Leeds out of the boat.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Come on!
Betty Brant: Guys, we gotta go!
[The water swirls into the air, forming the shape of a huge man. The colossal water monster roars.]
Ned Leeds: What is that?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I don’t know.
Ned Leeds: What’re you gonna do?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I left my suit in the hotel room.
Ned Leeds: Why?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Because I’m on vacation, Ned! Everyone’s gonna see my face, just get them outta here!
[Peter Parker pushes Ned Leeds towards the stairs where Betty Brant and MJ are waiting. The water monster smashes its hand into a building. More people scream. The creature continues to smash buildings and boats. Peter helps people off the stairs.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Get out of here. Go!
[Peter Parker turns back to the monster as it crashes into a building in front of him. Peter Parker stumbles back.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Oh, my God!
[Peter Parker runs up the stairs and barely makes it around the corner before the monster smashes into the building where he had been standing.]
[More people are screaming and running away.]
[Peter Parker hits his wrist together to activate his web-shooters.{
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Come on.
[Peter Parker moves around the corner and shoots a web at the monster. The web does nothing because the monster is made out of water. Peter Parker looks mildly exasperated.]
[People screaming]
[Peter Parker turns to see the monster heading towards a bridge swarming with people.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Oh no, you don’t!
[Peter Parker jumps across poles in the water and launches himself up onto the bridge by leaping off a peddle. He helps a man up.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: You okay? Get out of here. Go!
[The water monster slams it’s fist into the bridge and Peter Parker is sent flying backward.] [Peter hits the other side of the bridge, now soaking wet. He coughs up water, panting to catch his breath.]
[A green light is seen shooting at the monster from above. Behind Peter Parker, there is a rumbling sound and a cloud of green mist appears in the sky. Out of the mist, a man with an elaborate suit with a cape appears, wearing a glass bowl over his head that swirls with mist.]
[Peter looks around and sees a masquerade mask on the ground.]
[The mysterious man shoots green light at the monster, dodging its attacks as he flies through the air.]
[The man is thrown onto the ground and the monster roars.]
[The man emerges from the water and flies at the monster once again.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Excuse me sir! I c- I can help! Let me help! I’m really strong and I’m...sticky!
Mysterio: I need you to lead it away from the canals!
[The man flies off as the monster smashes into the building where Peter stands. Peter flips away, landing on a nearby roof.]
[The monster smashes through a building.]
[Peter swings around it, attaching webs to hold it together.]
~CUT TO THE TWO TEACHERS LEADING A SMALL GROUP OF STUDENTS~
Mr. Dell: The DaVinci Museum. This is why we’re here in Venice.
Mr. Harrington: Oh, this is it. It’s closed.
Mr. Dell: What do you mean it’s closed? ‘Till when?
[Brad and another student stand in front of the museum.]
Student: November.
Mr. Dell: [to Mr. Harrington] You didn’t check the website?
Mr. Harrington: Oh, that’s a good idea.
[Mysterio followed by a blast of water, shoot behind them and the group runs.]
~CUT TO PETER ON THE ROOF~
Peter sees that the bell tower is about to fall on a bunch of people.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Oh, come on!
[Peter swings towards the tower.]
Mr. Dell: [leading a group of students] Stay low, kids. We’ll be safe here.
[Peter is swinging around the bell tower, using webs to stick it back together. He lands in the top of the bell tower, ducking under the bell to get to the other side.]
[Peter takes off his mask, watching Mysterio fight the monster.]
[The bell tower starts to fall again.]
[Peter shoot a web, attaching it to two buildings across from him.]
[The monster hits the tower again.]
[Peter falls, his head hitting the bell, making it ring.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: [Groans]
[The tower cracks again, pulling Peter by his webs across it. Peter’s head hits the bell again.]
[The webs fall from the tower.]
[Peter shoots new webs, trying to hold the tower up.]
[Mysterio is still fighting the monster.]
~CUT TO GROUP OF STUDENTS WATCHING MYSTERIO~
Student: Who is that guy?
Brad Davis: I don’t know, but he’s kicking that water’s ass!
[Mysterio defeats the water monster.]
[Peter is still trying to keep the bell tower from falling. He yells out as the tower crumbles. His webs break and the tower finally crashes to the ground.]
[Mysterio lands and people begin cheering.]
[Peter gets up, checking the black dahlia necklace to make sure it’s not broken. He sighs in relief when he sees that it’s intact.]
[Mysterio salutes the crowd as they cheer for him before taking off and flying away in a cloud of green smoke.]
~CUT TO HOTEL~
[A handful of students are watching a television news report about Mysterio.]
Ned Leeds: It’s aliens. It has to be.
Flash Thompson: Buzzfeed says there’s a sailor named Morris Bench who was exposed to an experimental underwater generator and got hydro powers
Michelle / MJ: Yeah, you should definitely believe everything you read on the internet.
Flash Thompson: Spider-Man could take him.
Mr. Harrington: What do you think it is?
Mr. Dell: You know, being a man of science.... witches
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (on his phone away from the cluster of students) No, no, no, no. We wanna stay. We wanna stay.
May Parker: It’s a good thing I packed your suit, huh. I can’t believe you forgot it.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah.
May Parker: So, who was that guy you were with? Was that Mister Strange?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Doctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange. And, ummm... No. I don’t know who that was. He was a new guy. I was trying to help him, but...
[Peter is cut off by May on the other end of the phone]
May Parker: Hey, Happy. No. That’s my lunch. Don’t eat that one.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Happy’s there?
May Parker: Yeah. It’s Happy. He’s here. He came by to volunteer. And, he’s hanging around the office. And he wants to say hi.
Happy Hogan: (whispering to May) I don’t wanna...(May forces the phone into his hand) Hi, Peter
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hey, Happy...
Happy: I’m sorry. I’m working real hard here. I gotta do a... a leaflet drop.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What're you doing...
Happy Hogan: I’m glad you’re having a good time. Don’t worry. I’m really taking care of your aunt.
[Aunt May retracts the phone from Happy’s ear and focuses back on Peter.]
May Parker: So, uhh, how’s the plan going?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: There’s... some setbacks, for sure.
May Parker: Don’t ever think it, just trust your instincts and you’ll be fine.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I know. Love you. Bye.
Betty Brant: Who is that guy?
Brad Davis: He’s like Iron Man and Thor rolled into one.
Flash Thompson: (scoffs) He’s all right. He’s no Spider-Man.
Michelle / MJ: What is it with you and Spider-Man?
Flash Thompson: What? He’s just awesome, okay? He protects the neighborhood, and you know, he’s inspiring. He inspires me to be a better man.
[At this point, Peter reenters the cluster of students.]
Flash Thompson: (to Peter) ’Sup dickwad? I thought you drowned.
[woman on television speaking Italian]
Brad Davis: Sounds like his name’s Mysterio.
Michelle / MJ: L’uomo del Misterio is Italian for man of mystery. They don’t actually know who he is.
Ned Leeds: Mysterio...
Betty Brant: Cool name
Ned Leeds: Cool name
Betty Brant: Babe!
Ned Leeds: Babe!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (to MJ) So, how much did you actually see?
Michelle / MJ: Not much... I was running.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Right. me too. I was also running...away. So, Paris tomorrow. Go to the Eiffel Tower. Should be great.
Michelle / MJ: Yeah, I read it was secretly built as a mind-control antenna to create an army of the insane.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Oh...
Michelle / MJ: Which is why it’s my favorite destination on the whole trip.
[Peter and MJ smile at each other and then both look forward with a straight face.]
~NED AND PETER’S SHARED HOTEL ROOM~
Ned Leeds: What are you gonna do about the water monster?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Nothing. it’s dead. And besides, that Mysterio guy’s all over it. Look... I just wanna spend some time with MJ. We were talking about Paris and... I think she really likes me.
Ned Leeds: That’s nice. Reminds me of when Betty and I first fell in love. I had just finished my fruit cobbler, right-?
[Ned is hit with a dart in the neck by Nick Fury - who sits in a shaded corner of the room in a chair.]
Nick Fury: You’re a very difficult person to contact, Spider-Man.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: You’re Nick Fury. And you just shot Ned.
Nick Fury: It’s just a mild tranquilizer. He’ll be alright. So good to finally meet you. I saw you at the funeral, but I didn’t think that was a good time to exchange numbers.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, that would have been really inappropriate
Nick Fury: That’s what I just said.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Right.
Nick Fury: The important thing is, you’re here. I tried to bring you here. You avoided me, and now, you’re here. What a coincidence.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Wait. Was this a coincidence?
Nick Fury: I used to know everything. Then, I come back five years later and now, I know nothing. No intel, no team, and a high school kid is dodging my calls. Here’s what I do know... a week ago, a village in Mexico was wiped out by a cyclone. Witnesses say that cyclone had a face.
(Ned snores loudly)
Nick Fury: Three days later, a similar event in Morocco. A village was-
(a knock on the door cuts Fury off)
Mr. Harrington: Just making the rounds. See if anyone needs any emotional counseling after today’s traumatic event.
[Fury points his gun towards the door, hidden behind the wall so Mr. Harrington can't see him.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No. we‘re... we’re okay. We’re fine, thank you.
Mr. Harrington: Great. Cause I’m not qualified to actually...
(Ned snores)
Mr. Harrington: Oh, he’s passed out. I’m not really qualified to do it anyway, so... good night.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: That was my teacher, sorry about that. You were saying?
Nick Fury: A village was destroyed by what may well be another world-threatening...
(Fury is cut off again by another knock)
Betty Brant: Babe? You still awake? You’re not answering any of my texts.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Um... he’s asleep, Betty.
Betty Brant: Oh, already?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Mh-hmm. Yeah.
Betty Brant: Okay
Nick Fury: That’s why it’s imperative--
(Once more, another knock stops Fury.)
Mr. Dell: Hey, boys! So, that canal water today was filled with dangerous bacteria...
Nick Fury: (annoyed) Another person touches that door, you and I are going to attend another funeral. Suit up.
Mr. Dell: (In the background, still talking) ...let me know if either of you develops vomiting--
[Fury and Peter (who is in his Spider-Suit) are now seen on a boat]
Nick Fury: Stark left these for you. (He hands Peter a small case)
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Really?
[Peter opens the case to reveal a pair of glasses. The velvet lining of the case behind the glasses says "Stark Industries"]
Nick Fury: "Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown." (He looks at Peter) Stark said you wouldn't get that because it's not a Star Wars reference. (He scoffs)
[Cut to Peter and Fury walking into an underground base.]
Nick Fury: (to Peter) You can lose the mask. Everyone here's seen you without it. You'd only be feigning anonymity and breathing through spandex for no good reason.
[Peter pulls off his mask, taking in a deep breath.]
Nick Fury: Come on.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (quietly) Yeah.
Nick Fury: Over there we have Maria Hill. That is Dimitri.
(Dimitri cocks his gun)
Nick Fury: And this is Mr. Beck.
[A man wearing a cape turns around. We recognize his outfit as that of Mysterio.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Mysterio?
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: What?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Doesn't matter. It's just what my friends have been calling you.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Well, you can call me Quentin. (He holds out his hand for Peter to shake)
(Peter shakes his hand)
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: You handled yourself well out there today. I saw what you did with the tower. We could use someone like you on my world.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (softly) Thanks. I'm sorry. Your world?
Nick Fury: Mr. Beck is from Earth. Just not yours.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: There are multiple realities, Peter. This is Earth, Dimension 616. I'm from Earth 833.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (excitedly) I'm sorry, you're saying there's a multiverse? 'Cause I thought that was just theoretical. That completely changes how we understand the initial singularity. We're talking about an eternal inflation system and how does that even work with all the quantum--? It's insane--
(Peter realizes everyone has turned to look at him, unamused)
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: S-sorry. It's really cool. (he turns back to Beck)
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Don't ever apologize for being the smartest one in the room.
(Peter smiles)
Agent Maria Hill: Anyway...
A hologram appears on the table.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: They were born in stable orbits within black holes. Creatures formed from the primary elements: Air, water, fire, earth. The Science Division had a technical name. We just called them Elementals.
Agent Maria Hill: Versions of them exist across our mythologies.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Turns out, the myths are real.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Like Thor. Thor was a myth and now I study him in my physics class.
Nick Fury: These myths are threats.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: They first materialized on my Earth many years ago. We mobilized and fought them, but with each battle, they grew, got stronger. I was part of the last battalion left trying to stop them. All we did was delay the inevitable.
Agent Maria Hill: The Elementals are here now, attacking the same coordinates. Our satellites confirm it.
Nick Fury: So thank Mr. Beck for destroying the other three. There's only one left: fire.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: The strongest of them all. The one that destroyed my Earth. It's the one that took my family.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I'm sorry.
Agent Maria Hill: And it will be in Prague in approximately 48 hours.
Nick Fury: We have one mission: kill it. (to Peter) And you're coming with us.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I'm sorry. Did you say Prague? (laughs nervously) Mr. Fury, this all seems like bigtime, you know, huge superhero kinda stuff. And, I mean, I'm just a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.
Nick Fury: Bitch, please. You've been to space.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I know, but that was an accident. Sir, come on. There's gotta be someone else you can use. What about Thor?
Nick Fury: Off-world.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay, um, Doctor Strange.
Agent Maria Hill: Unavailable.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Captain Marvel.
Nick Fury: Don't invoke her name.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Sir, look, I really wanna help, I do. But if my aunt finds out that I left my class trip, she's gonna kill me. And if I'm seen like this in Europe, after the Washington Monument, my whole class will figure out who I am and then-- and then the whole world will figure out who I am, then I'm done.
Nick Fury: Okay. I understand.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I'm sorry, what?
Nick Fury: Why don't you get back before your teachers miss you and become suspicious. Dimitri. Take him back to hotel, please.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Thank you, Mr. Fury. And, uh, good luck.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: See ya, kid.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah, see you. (to Agent Hill) Bye, ma'am.
Agent Maria Hill: Yeah.
~CUT TO OUTSIDE THE HOTEL THE NEXT DAY~
Betty Brant: (talking to Ned) Okay, drink lots of water and I'm gonna get you a vitamin C pill. You cannot get sick, okay?
Ned Leeds: Okay. Thanks baby.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (exiting hotel) Hey, man. Are you sure you're good?
Ned Leeds: Oh, dude, I'm fine.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay.
Ned Leeds: Seriously, getting tranq'd in the neck by Nick Fury, probably the coolest thing to ever happen to me anyway.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: It is pretty awesome.
Ned Leeds: Yeah.
[They do a secret handshake.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I'm just happy I don't have to go to Prague.
Ned Leeds: Seriously.
Mr. Harrison: (exiting the hotel) Good news! We're going to Prague! Huh!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What?
Students: Prague?
Mr. Harrison: Yeah, tour company called. They upgraded us. You should've heard me on the phone with them. I really gave them hell. All I heard was crying.
~CUT TO STUDENTS ROUNDING CORNER OF BUILDING~
Mr. Harrison: Look at our upgraded ride!
Ned Leeds: Peter, wha-- What's going on?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I think Nick Fury just hijacked our summer vacation.
[The camera cuts to a large black bus. Dimitri is standing beside it with a sign that says "Midtown High".]
Mr. Harrington: (holding out his hand to Dimitri) I'm uh, Mr. Harrington to the kids, uh... (Dimitri doesn't respond) Okay.
[They board the bus.]
Ned Leeds: Awesome.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (unenthusiastically) Yeah. Awesome.
~EASTERN ALPS, AUSTRIA, AN OVERHEAD SHOT OF THE BUS DRIVING DOWN A LONG WINDING ROAD SURROUNDED BY TREES~
Flash Thompson: (live-streaming on his phone) Yo, what's up Flash Mob? It's your boy, the big F. (Dimitri looks mildly annoyed) Cruisin' through the Alps with my private driver, Dimitri.
(A shot of Peter's phone shows him reading an article titled Top 10 Romantic Places in Prague)
[Peter catches sight of the glasses case Fury had given him. He pulls it from his bag and opens it, putting on the Tony Stark-style glasses. He pulls out a note, reading it.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (reading aloud) "For the next Tony Stark, I trust you. (P.S.) say "Edith" (-T.S.)
[The glasses light up.]
E.D.I.T.H.: Stand by for retinal and biometric scan. (a scan of Peter's face appears) Retinal and biometric scan accepted.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hello?
E.D.I.T.H.: Hello, Peter. I am E.D.I.T.H., Tony Stark's augmented-reality security and defense system.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Huh. So, he made you for me?
E.D.I.T.H.: No. But you have access to all of Tony's protocols.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Cool.
E.D.I.T.H.: Would you like to see what I can do? E.D.I.T.H. stands for “Even dead, I’m the hero.” Tony loves his acronyms.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: [chuckles] Yeah, he did.
E.D.I.T.H.: I have access to the entire Stark Global Security network including multiple defense satellites as well as back does to all major telecommunication networks.
[an image of what each person on the bus is doing on their phone shows]
Mr. Dell: [The History of Witchcraft]
Student: [text: Hey Mom, Venice was crazy! Can you transfer me more money?]
Mr. Harrison: [text: Looks like things are finally looking up! Finally some good luck]
Dimitri: [[encrypted]]
Brad Davis: [internet search: Prague romantic...]
Flash Thompson: [text: Mother, have not heard from you or father in days]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Is MJ texting? No. Don’t look at it. That’s–that’s wrong. That’s wrong.
[He looks over at Ned and Betty who are sitting right next to each other]
Ned Leeds: [text: Miss you]
Betty Brant: [text: Miss you more]
Peter looks slightly bemused.
[The bus pulls up to a rest stop]
Dimitri: [exiting the bus] Petrol and toilets. Ten minutes!
Flash Thompson: [live streaming] Flash Mob, this is what we doing out here...
Mr. Dell: (frantically) Toilet, toilet, toilet. Which way to the toilet?
Mr. Harrison: Ten minutes everyone! Dimitri, where exactly are we? [Dimitri doesn’t respond] Yeah, okay, I’ll figure it out.
Betty Brant: Oh my gosh, it’s so sick. It’s beautiful.
[Peter exits the bus but is stopped by Dimitri]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What?
[Dimitri gestures to a building with an open door where a stern-looking woman in all black is waiting]
[Cut to Peter entering the building cautiously]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (nervously) Hello.
Female Agent: (slight accent) Close the door.
[Peter closes the door]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Um...I’m Peter Parker [he holds out his hand for the woman to shake]
Female Agent: [not shaking his hand] Take off your clothes.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (looking uncomfortable) Excuse me?
Female Agent: You told Fury Spider-Man cannot be seen in Europe. So I made you this [she grabs a black folded suit from her bag] another suit.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Oh, uh, thank you. [he takes the suit] I’m sure it fits fine I don’t need to try–
Female Agent: (insistently) Take off your clothes.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay... [he sets down his backpack] Sure. [he begins to unbutton his pants] It’s a little embarrassing.
Agent: Now! Hurry up!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: [unzipping pants] This is weird. [pulls pants down]
[The door opens and Brad enters. The agent reaches for her gun. Peter quickly stops her from shooting Brad.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, no, no. Don’t–
Brad Davis: Woah!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Uh...
Brad Davis: Sorry? Uh, I thought this was the bathroom.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: [panicked] This is not what it looks like. Just–
Brad Davis: Yeah [takes a picture]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What’re you doing?
Brad Davis: I’ll leave you two alone.
[The agent pulls out her gun and points it at Brad’s back as he leaves]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Oh my god. Don’t shoot anybody! Brad! [pulling up his pants as he runs out the door] It’s not what it looks like, buddy!
[He follows Brad outside, zipping up his pants]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hey, man, look, that’s–
Brad Davis: Look, Peter, I’m not here to judge your life’s choices, dude. If you wanna hook up with some random European chick on our school trip, that’s on you.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, that’s not what that was. Honestly.
Brad Davis: I can’t pretend I didn’t see what I just saw. I know you’re trying to get with MJ. It’s obvious. But I like her too.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Wait a minute. Hey, hey. You cannot show her that photo, dude. C’mon.
Brad Davis: I’m sorry, man. I have to. She deserves the truth. [he turns to walk back to the bus]
Mr. Dell: [exiting the bathroom] Okay, put your one foot in front of the other, and everybody back on the bus.
Mr. Harrison: It’s been ten minutes. Let’s go!
[Peter looks frustrated]
[CUT TO BACK ON THE BUS]
[Peter looks to the back of the bus, where he sees Brad on his phone. He turns back, and pulls out E.D.I.T.H.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: E.D.I.T.H.?
E.D.I.T.H.: Hello, Peter. How can I help you?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hey! Um... there's this guy in my class who's cutting in on everything I wanna do with MJ...
E.D.I.T.H.: Peter, I'm having difficulty hearing you. Can you please speak up?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Um... Brad Davis, he has a photo of me?
E.D.I.T.H.: Brad Davis. Is he a target?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: "Is he a target?" Um...
[Peter peeks his head around the seat to look at Brad. He's on his phone, the picture with Peter and the agent clearly displayed alongside it. He looks over to MJ and then returns to his seated position.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah. He's a target, he's a target.
E.D.I.T.H.: Copy that. Target is Brad Davis. Initiating strike.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: [surprised] Initiating what now?
E.D.I.T.H.: Intercept point determined. Releasing field vehicle.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: E.D.I.T.H.-
[Cut to a Stark Industries satellite in space. It releases something which drops into the atmosphere, burning up on entry and eventually revealing itself to be a weaponized drone. From the drone's HUD, we clearly see Brad Davis displayed as a target.]
[Cut back to the bus. Peter pulls off the E.D.I.T.H. glasses in shock.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Oh, my God...
[Flash reaches over and grabs the glasses out of his hand.]
Flash Thompson: Dope glasses Parker, how'd you pay for these?
[Peter frantically looks back and forth between Flash and the back of the bus, where the drone would be aiming, while trying to take the glasses back]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Flash, give 'em back. Give me the- Flash-
Flash Thompson: No, no, no. I'm really paying you a compliment.
[Flash looks earnestly at Peter while fending off his reaching attempts to get the glasses]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Please, give me the-
[Peter accidentally smacks Flash and knocks him out. He stares for a moment in shock]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I'm so sorry.
[Peter reaches over and reclaims the glasses, hurriedly shoving them on]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: E.D.I.T.H., don't kill Brad.
[Cut to E.D.I.T.H. glasses HUD as Peter looks at Brad. The HUD is danger red and displays information about the bus at the bottom along with a small image of Brad in the right corner]
E.D.I.T.H.: Peter, would you like me to cancel the drone strike on Brad Davis?
[Peter starts to nod]
Classmate: Did you just punch Flash?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No.
E.D.I.T.H.: Firing.
[Peter quickly turns and webs the wheel of the bus, causing it to swerve and a bullet from the drone to go through the side mirror]
Mr. Dell: Woah, look out! [specifically about the swerving, not about the bullet]
[Cut to outer view of the bus as it swerves wildly across the road, denting the side rail and nearly crashing into the side of the mountain]
[Cut back to inside the bus]
Mr. Dell: Aaa, this is not the autobahn!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: E.D.I.T.H.-
[Peter puts a hand up to where the side of the E.D.I.T.H. glasses should be, realizing that they fell off. Looking around frantically, he grabs them from the bus steps and quickly puts them back on]
E.D.I.T.H.: Commencing second strike.
Mr. Harrington: Peter, plant your fanny in that seat and buckle up right now.
[Peter points out the window, in an effort to distract him]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Look at the baby mountain goats!
Mr. Harrington: Baby mountain goats?! Ooh!
[Mr. Harrington and the entire rest of the class turn and look out that side of the bus]
[Cut to an aerial, slow-motion view of the bus as Peter leaps straight up through the emergency hatch at the top, hands forming the classic Spiderman web-shooting pose. A red light flashes on the drone as it prepares to fire again. Before it has the chance, Peter webs both the drone's guns over and then the drone itself to a large, passing boulder. This causes several small explosions on the drone before it snaps free from the rock, careening into the road where it explodes and smashes into pieces.]
[Cut back to the bus at normal speed where Peter drops back down, pulling the hatch closed behind him just in time for the rest of his class to turn back and stop searching for goats]
Mr. Harrington: Don't see any mountain goats.
[Peter, panting slightly and now with very windswept hair]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: You missed them.
Betty Brant: I know you think none of us have noticed, Peter.
[Both Peter and Ned look slightly panicked]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What?
Betty Brant: But your new look? I love it. Right babe?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Thanks.
[Distinctly relieved, Peter collapses back into his seat]
Ned Leeds: Yeah. Sophisticated, classy, very European.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (under his breath) Oh, man. Whoo. (normal volume) Let's try that again.
[Cut to Brad's phone as he quickly flips through his camera roll, expression confused and disbelieving]
Brad Davis: Uh, this is so weird. It was right here on my phone. I- I-
Michelle / MJ: Yeah, weird.
[MJ glances up toward Peter as the camera cuts to show his head stuck out in the aisle before he quickly pulls back]
[Cut to Flash as he wakes up, moving his jaw and putting his hand to his cheek, right where Peter accidentally knocked him out]
Flash Thompson: Ow.
[Cut to outside the bus as it pulls past a parking lot. The screen then fades to display a large building in the city with a large mural commemorating Tony Stark before panning down to show the street, just as the bus passes by. The words "PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC" appear in white across the screen before fading as the camera pans up to show the city in a state of celebration, the sky now dark.]
[Cut to a quieter street where the bus pulls into a parking spot outside another large building]
[Cut to inside the building, where two men in suits pull open the doors for the class. The camera switches vantage points, showing the large, fancy reception area of the hotel, which even includes a grand piano and pianoman]
Betty Brant: Wow, this place is so classy.
Classmate: Yeah, so why are we here?
Flash Thompson: [cocky] Speak for yourself. [chuckles] I'm home. [turns back to his phone where he's obviously gone back to vlogging]
Mr. Harrington: What can I say? The squeaky wheel gets the upgrade grease. Uh, everyone get settled in, rest up because tonight, big surprise, is Prague's annual...
[Peter's phone buzzes]
Mr. Harrington: Carnival of lights!
[Mr. Harrington gestures excitedly to a poster advertising the festival. Peter walks a little ways away to answer his phone]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hello?
Agent Maria Hill: Parker, it's Hill. There's an earpiece with your suit. Put in on and await further instructions. Understood?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Uh, yes, ma'am.
Agent Maria Hill: Yeah.
[Ned hurries over and throughout their conversation, they send quick glances back towards their class]
Ned Leeds: Hey, man. Look, I am so sorry if I seem preoccupied with my relationship. You know, I'm still your guy in the chair.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, no, it's all good. Don't worry about it.
Ned Leeds: Okay. Great, great.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: It's fine.
Ned Leeds: So, what's the status on the whole Elemental thing? Where's it going to happen?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Uh, here in the city
Ned Leeds: Peter, we're here.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I know, I know. It's not good. It's- I'm figuring it out.
Ned Leeds: You have to do something, Peter, please. We're all counting on you.
Betty Brant: [calling from back where the class has now clustered around Mr. Harrington as he shows them something] Ned.
Ned Leeds: Yeah. Yeah, babe.
[He hurries back over to the rest of the class]
Mr. Harrington: The good news is, we've all got our own rooms.
[As the class around Mr. Harrington exclaims in surprise and joy, Peter stares off into the distance, thinking and worrying about the elemental]
Nick Fury: (O.S.) Parker? Parker!
[Peter startles and turns around as we cut to a makeshift S.H.I.E.L.D. base.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yes, sir?
Nick Fury: That thing's going to be here in a few hours. Are we boring you?
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: He's not bored, he's just thinking about how you kidnapped him.
Nick Fury: He had obstacles. I removed them.
Agent Maria Hill: They still won't evacuate the city.
Nick Fury: (groans) Idiots. So what's the plan, Parker?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I will be in the cathedral tower keeping watch for the fire monster. When that shows up, I will radio you guys, and then Mr. Beck and I will-
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: My name is Mysterio.
[Quentin shoots Peter a playful look. Peter chuckles under his breath.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: That's when Mysterio and I will move in.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Peter, listen to me. The best hope you have -- the only hope -- is to stop it here and now, no matter what the cost. Keep it away from civilians if you can, but, most important, keep it away from metal. If it gets too big, it'll be able to draw power from the Earth's core. After that, there's no way to stop it.
[Peter briefly shares a glance with Fury.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hey, man, my friends are here? And I can't help but think we're putting them in danger-
[Fury stands up and walks over to Peter.]
Nick Fury: You're worried about us hurting your friends? You? Who called a drone strike on your own school tour bus? Stark gave you a multi-billion dollar AR tactical intelligence system and the first thing you do with it? Is try and blow up your friends. It's clear to me that you were not ready for this!
[We cut to Peter, sitting alone on a rooftop. Mysterio flies up towards him with his helmet on]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Look, Fury asked me to come up here and see how you were doing. He just, he felt bad about snapping at you.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (hopeful) Really?
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: You guys do have sarcasm on this Earth, right?
[Beck sits down, right next to Peter]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: How you feelin'?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I didn't think I was gonna have to save the world this summer. I know that makes me sound like such a jerk. I just... I had this plan with this girl that I really like, and...now it's all ruined.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (sympathetically) You're not a jerk for wanting a normal life, kid. It's a hard path. You see things, you do things... Make choices. People look up to you... Even if you win a battle sometimes, they die. I like you, Peter. You're a good kid. There's a part of me that wants me to tell you, just... turn around, run away from all this. And then, there's another part of me that knows what we're about to fight. What's at stake. And I'm glad you're here.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Me, too. (worried tone) But...
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (friendly) You're worried about your friends.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah. I just always feel like I'm putting them in danger.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Look, just... Get them inside and keep them in a safe place, for just a few hours. It'll be all right.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: It's really nice... to have somebody to talk to about, superhero stuff, you know?
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Anytime. And hey... (jokingly) We survive this, you'll have all summer to kill Brad.
[Peter and Quentin chuckle. Peter grabs his backpack.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: See you out there.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Alright.
[Peter jumps off the building and lands on the floor. An old couple takes notice and looks at him.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Scusi! Sorry, that's Italian...
[Peter pulls the E.D.I.T.H. glasses out of his bag]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay, uh, E.D.I.T.H.?
[The glasses initialize and Peter waits impatiently.]
E.D.I.T.H.: Hello, Peter.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hey! Uh... I need to find out a way to keep my friends inside for the next few hours.
E.D.I.T.H.: Let's see what we can do.
[Cut to the class in the hotel lobby. Some students have glow sticks in preparation for the Carnival of Lights.]
Mr. Harrington: Good news. We’re going to the opera!
[Students, except for Peter, are confused and a bit upset. Their response are simultaneous and varying.]
Some students: The opera?
Some other students: What?
At least one student: You’re kidding me.
At least one student: Why?
Mr. Dell: Don’t look at me.
Michelle / MJ: What happened to the carnival?
Mr. Harrington: Oh this is upgrade living, guys.
[Cut to a shot of Ned looking back at Peter. Peter, with his widened eyes and slow nodding, gestures to Ned that this was his doing.]
Mr. Harrington: Come on. The tour company just gave us these tickets. For free! Do you have any idea how much opera tickets cost?
Flash Thompson: No, because none of us have ever wanted to go to the opera, ever.
Ned Leeds: Uh… well I think this is gonna be culturally enriching for us.
[Mr. Harrington points at Ned.]
Mr. Harrington: Thank you, Ned. Everyone, this is gonna be, maybe, the best four hours of our whole trip.
All students, except Peter Parker and Ned Leeds: Four hours?
Ned Leeds: Guys, I think this is gonna be really fun. Seriously.
[Cut to the class walking through the streets of Prague, with Mr. Harrington leading the group. The whole class is dressed in formal attire, heading toward the opera theatre. There are fireworks in the sky and a huge crowd of people in costumes walking around.]
Mr. Harrington: I bet now you’re all happy I had you pack a nice outfit.
Flash Thompson: Yeah, because we’d much rather go to a four-hour opera instead of the biggest party in the world.
Mr. Dell: Again, don’t look at me.
[We see Peter and MJ walking beside each other, with Brad walking behind them.]
Agent Maria Hill: (over radio) Parker, do you copy? Comm check, one, two.
[Brad looks at MJ and looks at Peter suspiciously.]
[Cut to the opera theatre. The seats are barely filled. The seats that are filled are occupied by elderly people. The class enters the theatre. They pause briefly.]
Mr. Harrington: Okay, here we are. Beat the rush.
Mr. Dell: Yeah, the rush out.
Mr. Harrington: Lucky for us, we got the best seats in the house.
[The class begins walking toward their assigned seats, which are at the front of the theatre.]
Mr. Dell: Let’s go.
[MJ stops briefly to look up and around the lavish opera theatre. Brad is in front of her and turns toward and walks backwards slightly.]
Brad Davis: Hey. (pointing toward their seats) I’ll save you a seat.
[Brad walks away. MJ makes an awkward smile. Peter enters the theatre just behind her. Peter walks up slowly right next to her. The orchestra can be heard tuning.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (to MJ) You look really pretty.
Michelle / MJ: And therefore, I have value?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, that’s not what I meant at all. I was just…
Michelle / MJ: I’m messing with you.
[Peter and MJ both share a chuckle.]
Michelle / MJ: Thank you.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: You’re welcome.
Michelle / MJ: You look pretty too.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Thank you.
[Their awkwardness is interrupted by Betty and Ned, who just entering the theatre.]
Betty Brant: Oh, my gosh! Opera glasses!
Ned Leeds: So cute.
Betty Brant: Can I…?
[We cut back to Peter and MJ only.]
Michelle / MJ: Wanna go in on a pair?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: You mean, let’s sit next to each other?
Michelle / MJ: Yeah.
Nick Fury: (to Peter, over radio) Are you in position?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No.
Michelle / MJ: Okay. No-
Nick Fury: (over radio) Why the hell not?
Michelle / MJ: -you don’t want to sit next to me?
Nick Fury: Parker?
Michelle / MJ: Or no you just don’t want the glasses?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I didn’t mean that. Uh… Uh… If you go ahead, I’ll go grab us a pair.
Michelle / MJ: I’ll save you a seat next to me because…
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Awesome.
Michelle / MJ: … a lot of seats, so I’ll be up there.
[Peter and MJ nod.]
Michelle / MJ: Okay.
[MJ walks towards the front of the theatre.]
Nick Fury: Parker.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, I’m coming. I’m…
[Betty walks past him. Ned walks right up to him.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (to Ned) Hey, I gotta go. Could you tell MJ that I’m sick or something?
Ned Leeds: O-o-okay. Be careful. And Peter, whatever you do, please steer the monster away from the opera house.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah, Ned, I know.
Ned Leeds: Okay.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay?
[Betty looks at Peter and Ned with her pair of opera glasses.]
Ned Leeds: Yeah.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Gotta go.
[Peter runs off. Ned rejoins Betty and they walk together. Just before leaving the opera, he holds onto a column and looks back toward Ned, Betty and MJ. The opera ‘The Devil’s Wall’ by Bedrich Smetana begins. Brad, who is seated one seat away from MJ stands up and looks back at Peter. The red curtains of the theatre rise. Brad lifts the middle finger at Peter and sits right next to MJ. Peter is angry and is about to go into the theatre again.]
Nick Fury: (over radio) Parker! You better be on your way.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Coming.
[Peter begrudgingly leaves the theatre. MJ looks back to see Peter gone. MJ gets up from her seat and leaves the theatre.]
Betty Brant: (whispering to Ned) Where do you think she’s going? Do you think she’s going to the carnival?
Ned Leeds: Oh, I…
Betty Brant: We should go too.
Ned Leeds: (shaking his head) I don’t…
Betty Brant: Yes, we should go. Come on, let’s go. Come on.
[Ned is frustrated.]
[Cut to an aerial view of Prague at night. There are fireworks in the distance. Areas are lit with multi-colored lights.]
[Cut to Peter in his new Stealth Suit. He’s on the side at the top of the cathedral tower. Fireworks go above and around him, which briefly illuminate him. He flips and perchs himself in a lower part on the outside of the cathedral tower.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: All right. I’m in position. Uh… As soon as I see something, Beck, I’ll uh… I’ll let you know.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Roger that.
Nick Fury: (to Peter, over radio) How’s the suit?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Uh the suit’s great. It’s awesome. It’s a little tight around the old web-shooter.
Nick Fury: (over radio) Parker!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay, I’ll shut up.
[Cut to Ned and Betty walking in a crowd at the carnival.]
Betty Brant: Oh, my God, babe, isn’t this beautiful?
Ned Leeds: Yeah, it’s, it’s real…. real beautiful, babe.
Betty Brant: What’s wrong?
Ned Leeds: You know, honestly, I just… I don’t do well with big crowds, so maybe we should…
Betty Brant: (looking at something) I have the perfect thing. Come on.
[Betty pulls Ned along towards something.]
[MJ is shown looking around in the carnival behind a carousel.]
[Ned and Betty are sitting in a ferris wheel passenger car. The passenger car begins to go up.]
Betty Brant: Don’t worry, babe. We’ll get away from the crowds, get some fresh air. You’ll feel a thousand times better.
[We cut back to MJ. MJ is standing in front of a fountain, which is steaming.]
[Cut to Nick Fury and Maria Hill in the makeshift S.H.I.E.L.D. base.]
Nick Fury: Energy spiking.
Agent Maria Hill: We have seismic activity.
[We cut to MJ. She looks at the ground. The cement ground begins breaking, revealing magma flowing underneath. The lava flows out and moves up a statue and wraps around it. MJ and other people begin running away. Yelling can be heard in the crowd. The statue explodes revealing the Fire Elemental. It roars.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (noticing the apparition of the Fire Elemental) Okay, he’s here! Beck, are you ready? You know what to do.
[Beck flies in from above toward the FIre Elemental.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: On your lead, Spider-Man.
[The Fire Elemental jumps from the statue’s original position to the ground and smashes a vehicle. The Fire Elemental grows as it’s absorbing the metal. It roars again. The crowd is running away. The ferris wheel operator has run away as well. Betty and Ned are left on the ferris wheel, high above the ground, panicking.]
Betty Brant: (to the operator) No, come back! Come back and help us!
[The Fire Elemental destroys and smashes several structures. Sparks, fireballs and smoke are seen. A cloud of green smoke drops to the ground in front of the Fire Elemental, revealing Mysterio. He steps forward, stretching his arms out. Magic green triangles rotate in front of his hands.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: You’re up, kid.
[Peter swings in from above and throws a wooden structure at the Fire Elemental. The Fire Elemental stumbles forward a bit. Peter lands on the side of a wall and looks back at the Fire Elemental. He shoots a web at a fire hydrant. Beck shoots two green laser beams from his hands at the Fire Elemental. Peter pulled out the fire hydrant, which releases at high pressure jet of water from the ground at the Fire Elemental. The Fire Elemental roars and is enveloped in steam.]
[Betty and Ned both look at Peter/Spider-Man.]
Betty Brant: Wait, w-wait. Is that…? Do you think that’s Spider-Man?
Ned Leeds: Uh-uh… No, no, no. It’s like a European rip-off version of him. I was actually reading about him the other day. It’s not him.
[The Fire Elemental roars again and charges toward Peter. It tries to punch Peter, but instead punches the wall Peter was attached to. Peter evades its attack with a backflip and he lands on the carousel. The Fire Elemental destroys the carousel, sending Peter to the ground. The Fire Elemental is holding the destroyed metallic pieces from the carousel.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, Beck! He’s got the carousel! He’s getting bigger!
[Ned and MJ look down at Spider-Man.]
Betty Brant: (to Ned) What’s his-what’s his name? What’s his name?
Ned Leeds: Uh-uh… It’s N-Night… Night Monkey.
Betty Brant: Night Monkey?
Ned Leeds: Yeah. Yeah.
Betty Brant: (to Peter) Night Monkey!
Ned Leeds: Yeah.
Betty Brant: Night Monkey, help!
Ned Leeds: Night Monkey.
Betty Brant: Save us!
[Peter looks up at the ferris wheel and sees Betty and Ned.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What?
Betty Brant: Night Monkey, we’re stuck!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (to himself) Oh, no, no.
Betty Brant: Help us! Help!
[Peter looks back at the Fire Elemental, who has grown larger and taller due to absorbing more metal.The Fire Elemental roars loudly. Peter uses his web-shooters and shoots at the Fire Elemental, however the webs catch on fire and the fire moves down the web toward Peter. Fire Elemental walks toward Peter’s direction and is about the smash Peter with its enormous hand, when suddenly Beck comes in the nick of time to protect Peter by creating a green energy dome. The Fire Elemental tries to damage the green force field.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Are you okay?
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: On to Plan B?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah! We gotta hit him with something he can’t absorb!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: I go left, you go right! Now!
[The two split up. Beck flies up. The Fire Elemental focuses on Peter and begins charging at him and launching flames at him. Peter runs from it. Peter swings to the top of a building and runs up the wall and back-flips off of it to avoid any fires. In mid-air, Peter shoots his webbing at a large rock and launches it at the Fire Elemental, with the aid of a lamp post. He hurts the Fire Elemental.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (to Beck) Okay, shoot at him!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (shooting at the Fire Elemental) Yeah!
[Peter lands atop a lamp post. ]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: That hurt him. Keep it coming!
[Peter uses his webs to grab another debris of concrete and throws it at the Fire Elemental. Beck fires at the debris that is stuck in the chest of the Fire Elemental. The Fire Elemental wacks Beck out of the air.]
[Cut to a driver’s seat view of Fury and Hill in a car heading to where the attack is taking place.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (over radio) Spider-Man, keep your distance!
[Fury and Hill’s vehicle is followed by two other black Audi SUVs.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I’m trying!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: We can’t let him get near the ferris wheel!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay. I’m on it!
[Peter falls to the ground and smashes into a vehicle. The Fire Elemental roars and smashes the ground. The ground cracks and they flaming cracks travel to the ferris wheel. This tips the ferris wheel a bit.]
Betty Brant: (screams)
Ned Leeds: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
[The Fire Elemental notices the pair screaming and shouting and begins heading toward the ferris wheel. Beck flies between the Fire Elemental and the ferris wheel and blasts green laser beams from his hands, which hit the hand of the Fire Elemental. The Fire Elemental is pushed back slightly and struggles against Beck. Peter runs toward the ferris wheel and shoots his webbing at an invisible object.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Whoa, what is that?!
[Peter pulls at it and it flies behind him into an alleyway. MJ, who is hiding in the alleyway, spots the object with Spider-Man’s webbing on it. The ferris wheel continues to tip slightly.]
Betty Brant: (screams)
Ned Leeds: Betty! Betty!
[Peter runs toward the ferris wheel while Beck continues to halt the Fire Elemental’s advance. Peter shoots a web to the ferris wheel and one to the building wall behind it. Fury’s motorcade arrives at the scene. In the background, Peter continues shooting webs from the ferris wheel to the wall to prevent it from falling down. Beck’s lasers accidentally hit the windshield of Fury and Hill’s vehicle and we see three spider-web-shaped glass shatter patterns on the windshield, like those caused by a gun. The motorcade stops and Fury and Hill step out of their vehicle. Peter keeps the ferris wheel still by pushing it toward the wall. Beck shoots his laser beams at the Fire Elemental, causing it to back up more.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: That’s it! Nice! Nice! You got him!
[The Fire Elemental backs up into scaffolding, which the Fire Elemental absorbs.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: No, no, no.
[Beck shoots laser beams at the Fire Elemental, but it’s too large to stop. It grows larger and roars fiercely. Maria Hill looks up at it in fear.]
Agent Maria Hill: It’s too late.
[Beck looks back at Peter.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Whatever happens….
[Beck’s mask disappears briefly.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: I’m glad we met.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Beck, what are you doing?
[Beck stares at the Fire Elemental. Beck’s mask comes back..]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: What I should have done last time.
[Beck summons all his power and yells.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Beck, don’t do it!
[Beck continues drawing in all his power and snaps his finger. He flies towards the Fire Elemental and enters its chest. The Fire Elemental begins to turn green. It collapses, disintegrating in a green, misty explosion that spreads throughout the nearby areas of Prague. Peter sets his webbing aside and attaches it on the ferris wheel to hold onto the ferris wheel. Peter witnesses Beck lying on the ground, face down. He drops down from the ferris wheel and runs toward him to checks on him.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (turning Beck over) Mr. Beck?
[Beck is breathing. He looks like he’s been in a sauna.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Oh, thank God.
[Peter pulls an injured Beck from the ground.]
[Cut to Ned and Betty on the ferris wheel, who were watching Spider-Man and Mysterio. Betty looks back at Ned.]
Betty Brant: I would totally kiss you, but I think I just threw up in my mouth a little.
Ned Leeds: I... I mi- I might have a mint!
[Cut back to the ground. Beck, Parker, and the SHIELD team sit amongst the rubble.]
Agent Maria Hill: So, it's over?
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: That was the last of them.
Nick Fury: But not the last threat we'll ever face. We need to stay vigilant. There's a void in this world for someone like you. Hill and I are going to Europol headquarters in Berlin tomorrow. You should join us.
[Quentin stands, clasping Fury's hand.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Thank you. I just might take you up on that.
[Fury turns to where Peter stands still as a statue and walks over. Beck sits back down.]
Nick Fury: You got gifts, Parker. But you didn't wanna be here.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Mr. Fury, I--
Nick Fury: I'd love to have you in Berlin, too. But you've got to decide whether you're going to step up or not. Stark chose you. He made you an Avenger. I need that. The world needs that. Maybe Stark was wrong. Was he?
[Peter begins to tear up.]
Nick Fury: The choice is yours.
[Fury walks away from Peter, who casts his eyes down in shame. Beck stands and walks over to Peter, placing a hand on his shoulder.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Let's get a drink.
[Quentin walks offscreen and Peter turns to look at him.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I'm not twenty-one...
[Cut to the inside of a packed bar. Quentin holds a bottle of beer in his hand and Peter looks down, dejected, at his glass.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Hey.
[Quentin pats Peter on the shoulder.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: You gotta celebrate, you did something good tonight.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah...
[Quentin pats him on the back.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Fury was right. Tony did a lot for me, so... I owe it to him, to everybody.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Do you?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah! I mean... Mr. Stark gave me the chance to be more, he wanted me to be better than him, and Fury just wants me to live up to that.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: What do YOU want, Peter?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What do you mean?
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: What do you want?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: …uh, I don’t… know…
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: What do you want, you, Peter Parker, right now? I know you’re thinking about it! What do-
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I wanna go on my trip Right? I wanna go back on my trip, with my friends. I wanna go to the top of the Eiffel Tower with the girl who I like and tell her how I really feel, and… give her a kiss! I don’t…
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Ooh!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Shut up, man! I...
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: But you're not gonna do that, are you?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, I can't!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Why not?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Because I have too much of a responsibility!
[A local picks up the E.D.I.T.H. glasses and hands them to Peter.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Oh, my God, thank you so much!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: What are those? Are those the...?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: E.D.I.T.H. glasses, yeah!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: It was on the floor? Try them on, let's see how they look on you.
[Peter puts on the glasses and looks at Quentin.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: ...I actually really like them!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Can I be completely honest with you?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Please.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: They look really stupid.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Oh.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: But maybe they have a contact-lens version of them.
[Peter takes off the glasses.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: You try 'em on.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: No, c'mon!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Try 'em on!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: I don't wanna- I don't wanna try 'em on!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Just put 'em on!
[Beck takes the glasses from Peter and puts them on.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: What do you think, kid?
[Peter stares at Quentin for a long time, then breaks eye contact.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (to himself) "To the next Tony Stark, I trust you..." "To the next Tony Stark, I trust you."
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: What?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Mr. Stark left me a message with those glasses; "To the next Tony Stark, I trust you."
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: I'm still not following. How many lemonades have you had?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: He knew every mistake I ever made, okay? So he must've known I was not ready for something like this.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Why would he give it to you?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Because maybe he didn't trust me to have E.D.I.T.H., he just trusted me to pick who should. It makes so much more sense, he always knew I would do what's right and he's not gonna give them to Fury because Fury would just give himself E.D.I.T.H.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Alright, you're probably right about that.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Right, so, the world needs the next Iron Man... and it's not gonna be me! I mean, I'm a sixteen-year-old kid from Queens. It needs to be an adult with some experience and that's good like Tony Stark, like you.
[Quentin looks at Peter for a moment and takes the glasses off.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: No, c'mon, Peter... No.
[Peter takes the glasses and puts them on.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: E.D.I.T.H.?
E.D.I.T.H.: Hello, Peter.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hi! Yeah, um... I'd like to transfer your control over to Quentin Beck.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Peter, what are you doing?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I'm doing the right thing.
E.D.I.T.H.: Any transfer will require confirmation.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Stark gave you the glasses!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Stark gave me a choice! It's my choice to make, okay? And I'm gonna make it. Look, you're a soldier, a leader, you stopped the Elementals, you saved my life, you saved the world! Okay? He'd want you to have them.
E.D.I.T.H.: Waiting for confirmation.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Confirm.
[Peter takes off the glasses and holds them out to Quentin.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Welcome to the Avengers.
[Quentin puts the glasses on as a few notes of Alan Silvestri's Avengers theme play in the background. The two shake hands.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Thank you. It's an honor.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah.
[Peter slings his backpack over his shoulder, standing up to leave.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Mr. Stark would've really liked you.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Where you headed?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I'm gonna go find MJ.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Good luck, kid. I'll give you about a fifty-fifty chance, you're pretty awkward, so...
[Peter laughs.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah. See ya later, man!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: See ya!
[Just as Peter has left the bar, several things start to gradually disappear, both objects and people are revealed to be holograms. Quentin, sitting in the middle of the illusion, starts to smile]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: See? That wasn't so hard.
[The people that haven't vanished, erupt in applause and cheers]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (overjoyed) Somebody get this stupid costume off me!
[Outside, Peter walks past a memorial for Tony Stark, smiling and convinced he has done the right thing. In the "bar", Quentin, now without his superhero clothes, hands the glasses to one of his associates]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Okay, we got E.D.I.T.H.. Get these connected to our system.
Mysterio's Crew: Toast! Toast! Toast! Toast!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (trying to calm them) Now, this is a big win, but we still got a lot of work to do.
Mysterio's Crew: Toast! Toast! Toast! Toast!
[It's clear that there's no chance to stop the victory whirl, so Quentin steps on the counter]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Okay, toasts! Give me that, Doug! (grabs a bottle of champagne) To the man who brought us all together, our former boss, Tony Stark.
[He lifts the bottle in the air]
Mysterio's Crew: Boo!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: The jester king. Literally wrapped in wealth and technology that he was unfit to wield. Like the holographic system I designed. A revolutionary breakthrough with limitless applications that Tony turned into a self-therapy machine and renamed...
[Brief flashback of Tony in Captain America: Civil War, where Tony Stark presents his final meeting with his parents, using the same holographic technology]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF...
[The crowd laughs while the hologram disappears and Tony takes off his glasses]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Oh, $611,000,000 for my little therapeutic experiment...?
[Zoom in, Quentin Beck is standing behind Tony, with a disgusted grimace on his face]
Quentin Beck (vo): He renamed my life's work BARF.
[Back to the present]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: I told him that it was a mistake. That my technology can change the world. And then... He fired me. Said I was... unstable. (determined) To Tony!
Mysterio's Crew: (all holding champagne) To Tony!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Next, to William.
[We get a brief flashback to the movie that started it all, Iron Man, where Obediah Stane yells at one of his employees, William Ginther Riva]
Obediah Stane: (yelling, pointing at William) Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps!
[Brief zoom in, a wipe brings us back to the current William]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: The integration of my illusion tech, with your weaponized drones, was brilliant. Powerful illusions, real damage, worked like a charm. And it's just the beginning.
William Ginther Riva: (proud) Thank you, brother.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: To Guterman.
[Cut to another man, Quentin Beck's story writer and acting coach]
Mysterio's Crew: To Guterman!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: The story you created of a soldier from another earth named Quentin fighting space monsters in Europe is totally ridiculous! And apparently exactly the kind of thing people will believe right now! I mean, everybody bought it!
[More cheers from the group]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: To Victoria.
Mysterio's Crew: To Victoria!
[Cut to a woman in her late twenties, early thirties]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Staging electromagnetic pulses at each attack site so Fury's own satellites would confirm our lies? Inspired idea. To Janice!
[Cut to another woman]
Mysterio's Crew: Janice!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: After Tony died, she was the one who discovered that E.D.I.T.H. was being handed over -- not to us, not to the Defense Department, but to a child.
Janice: Thank you!
Man: (among the cheers) To Janice!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: And to the rest of you, Tony Stark is gone. There is a window of opportunity and someone will step up. But these days, you can be the smartest guy in the room, the most qualified, and no one cares. Unless you're flying around with a cape, or shooting lasers from your hands, no one will even listen. Well... I've got a cape. And lasers. (soft laughter) With our technology, and with E.D.I.T.H., Mysterio will be the greatest hero on Earth! (more cheers) And everyone will listen! Not to a boozy man-child!
Mysterio's Crew: No!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Not to a hormonal teenager!
Mysterio's Crew: No!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: To me! And to my very wealthy crew! To us.
Mysterio's Crew: To us!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (lifting the bottle) To Mysterio!
Mysterio's Crew: To Mysterio!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: To Peter Parker.
Mysterio's Crew: To Peter Parker!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (a bit of guilt) Poor kid. (back to business) Let's get to work.
[Peter is running up a flight of stairs in the hotel. Ned enters the scene, dressed in a bathrobe, from a corridor on the left side of the shot.]
Ned Leeds: Peter, oh my God!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hey. Hey.
[Peter and Ned are hugging]
Ned Leeds: We almost died.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: It’s fine. It’s fine. Hey, guess what? I’m done with the mission.
Ned Leeds: Dude, the trip’s over.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What?
Ned Leeds: There’s monsters coming out of the ground everywhere we go. Of course our parents would want us home.
[Mr. Harrington comes out of a hotel room, on the phone with parents]
Mr. Harrington: (talking on the phone) Please, don’t put me on hold. (to Peter, as he notices him) Oh Peter! You’re not dead. Oh, my God. Yes, good. Stay here. Don’t die. (to Ned) Put some clothes on. We’re booking flights!
[Mr. Harrington exits the scene. Mr. Dell comes from the direction Mr. Harrington leaves in and converses with Peter and Ned.]
Mr. Dell: We came for science, we’re leaving because of witches. Welcome to the new Dark Ages.
[Mr. Dell enters a room.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What is going on?
Ned Leeds: We’re going home in the morning.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, no, no. All the Elementals are gone.
[Betty calls to Ned from her hotel room door.]
Betty Brant: Ned!
Ned Leeds: Coming, sweetie.
[Ned leaves to go to Betty’s room. Flash opens his hotel room door.]
Flash Thompson: Hi, can you guys keep it down? I’m live-streaming.
[Flash closes his door. A hotel room door opens, revealing MJ.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (to Flash) Yeah.
Michelle / MJ: (to Peter) Hey.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hey!
Michelle / MJ: Where were you?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Um, I got lost.
Michelle / MJ: We were worried about you.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Oh.
Michelle / MJ: Good thing you’re back.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah.
Michelle / MJ: So much for Paris, right?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Would’ve been fun.
Michelle / MJ: Yeah. Night.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Night.
[MJ closes door. Peter is unable to complete his sentence before her door closes ]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: You look ni…
[Peter musters up the courage to go toward MJ’s hotel room door.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (to himself) Okay.
[Peter goes toward her door. Before Peter reaches her door, it opens]
Michelle / MJ: (Startled) Oh!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hey.
Michelle / MJ: Hey.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Uh… Look, um...I’m not ready for this trip to be over yet, and I kind of want to do something fun that’s not on the itinerary or planned or with Mr. Harrington.
Michelle / MJ: Yes.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: “Yes,” like you wanna go?
Michelle / MJ: Yes.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay, awesome. I’ll see you outside in ten minutes.
Michelle / MJ: Meet me outside in five minutes.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Five is good.
Michelle / MJ: Okay.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay, bye.
Michelle / MJ: Bye. Huh.
[A Czech news broadcast of Mysterio and Spider-Man’s battle with Molten Man in Prague is shown. The chyron reads “Mysterio a Night Monkey v Praze”, which translates to “Mysterio and Night Monkey in Prague”. Video footage of the attack is shown. The first clip shows Ned and Betty stuck in a ferris wheel passenger car. Betty Brant is shouting, “Night Monkey, help us! Help! Night Monkey!” The second clip shows Mysterio protecting himself and Spider-Man from an attack by Molten Man. The scene cuts to Peter, who is currently watching the news broadcast in the hotel lobby. He smiles to himself. The elevator bell rings and MJ emerges. Peter and MJ walk toward each other.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hey!
Michelle / MJ: Hey.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Uh… so… where do you wanna go?
Michelle / MJ: Who cares?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Awesome.
Michelle / MJ: Okay.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Let’s go.
[Peter and MJ begin walking out of the hotel. Brad is shown to be sitting in one of the chairs in the lobby with his computer, as he notices the pair walking out together.]
[Peter Parker and MJ are walking along Charles Bridge in Prague]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I’m glad we’re doing this.
Michelle / MJ: Yeah, me...me too.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: To see the city a little bit.
Michelle / MJ: You know they used to execute people on this bridge. They would like-
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Oh?
Michelle / MJ: -put them in a basket and they would like drown them in water. Sorry.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: It’s okay. Uh...like there’s this thing that I’ve been wanting to talk to you about for a while.
Michelle / MJ: Yeah?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: It’s our last night in Europe and I had this plan that I wanted to tell you. I’m just gonna...I’m just gonna tell you. Uh... MJ I-
Michelle / MJ: am Spider-Man.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What?
Michelle / MJ: That’s what you were gonna say that you’re Spider-Man.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No. I’m not Spider-Man.
Michelle / MJ: I mean I’ve been watching you for like a while now it’s... kind of obvious.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I’m not Spider-Man. I mean what would make you think that I was Spider-Man.
Michelle / MJ: Peter, Washington?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah?
Michelle / MJ: The fact that you like disappear, out of nowhere, for no reason.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, that was, I was sick. Remember, I had my… the tummy?
Michelle / MJ: You know Susan Yang thinks that you’re a male escort.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What? No, of course I’m not a male escort!
Michelle / MJ: Well then you’re Spider-Man.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, I’m not Spider-Man at all!
Michelle / MJ: What about tonight? You snuck off and fought that thing. I saw you.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: You can’t have seen me because I’m not Spider-Man and also on the news it was the Night Monkey.
Michelle / MJ: The Night Monkey?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah. That’s what it said on the news... and the news never lies.
Michelle / MJ: (Chuckling) Night Monkey. Okay.
[MJ takes off backpack]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What are you doing?
Michelle / MJ: (Unzips backpack and reaches inside) Well do the Night Monkey and Spider-Man use the same webs?
[MJ reveals an object with spider webs attached to it that she recovered]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I mean maybe. Maybe he’s a spider monkey, who knows? Were you only watching me because you thought I was Spider-Man?
Michelle / MJ: Yeah. Why else would I be watching you?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Doesn’t matter. Just thought that maybe-
[Projector inexplicably goes off and MJ drops it. The projector briefly shows the Air Elemental, "Cyclone"]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: The hell was that?
Michelle / MJ: I don’t know.
[Peter and MJ look around shocked and frightened by what they just witnessed. Peter moves cautiously forward and bends down to pick it up.]
Michelle / MJ: What is it like some kind of projector or something?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah but it’s... really advanced.
Michelle / MJ: It looked so real.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah really real.
Michelle / MJ: Wait a minute does that mean that
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: The Elementals are fake? But that doesn’t make any sense because we were there right? There was fire and destruction and… who would do something like that?
[Projector goes off once again showing the Air Elemental but this time also showing Mysterio fighting it.]
Michelle / MJ: Mysterio?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (Realizing Mysterio's deception, he turns to face MJ) I am Spider-Man. And I really messed up.
Michelle / MJ: Wait, you’re being serious right now?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Mhm.
Michelle / MJ: You’re not joking with me like you’re a hundred percent serious ‘cause it’s not funny.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No I’m not joking.
Michelle / MJ: ‘Cause I was… I was only like sixty-seven percent sure.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: MJ
Michelle / MJ: So why, why are you here? Why-
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: MJ
Michelle / MJ: Why are you on this school trip?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: MJ look I know you have a lot of questions but look, we really have to get out of here okay?
Michelle / MJ: Okay. Okay. Can’t believe I figured it out!
[Peter Parker and MJ run back to the hotel]
*****
[We see Mysterio flying around some kind of a storm Elemental, firing lasers at it]
Quentin Beck: You took everything from me! This is for my family!
[The camera pans down, several people of Mysterio's crew admire or inspect the scene, while William is looking on his phone.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Pause. Pause?
[We see Quentin Beck standing in the middle of the room, which looks suspiciously like a movie studio. He wears a motion capture outfit]
William Ginther Riva: (looking up) Sorry.
[William pauses the illusion]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Yeah, uh, can you just fast-forward to the end?
William Ginther Riva: Yeah. Standby.
[The visual flashes forward to the climax]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (mumbling to himself) Right. Fly, fly, fly... Zap, zap, zap... Pause.
[The Elemental freezes again]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: I'm not in love with this choreography, but it'll do. Kill image.
[The illusion disappears]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Decloak drones.
[Where the Elemental used to be, several drones appear out of thin air when their cloaking devices are deactivated]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Right, weapons?
William Ginther Riva: You wanna weaponize them?
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Yup.
William Ginther Riva: Weapons only. Standby.
[Several drones fly towards some prop pillars in the lot, firing at them as they fly by.]
William Ginther Riva: Nice.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Stop. Something... I don't know what it is. It's something... Just dou... You know what? Double the damage, and then run it again.
William Ginther Riva: You want me to double it up?
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Yeah.
William Ginther Riva: Alright. Cover your ears.
[The image of the Elemental appears again. Through the underlying drones, it seems like he punches the pillars to pieces. Shortly thereafter, the holographic Mysterio fires a laser at it and defeats it]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: That's good! That's good.
[William gives two thumbs up]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: We're on schedule?
William Ginther Riva: Oh, yeah. Uploading software hack to E.D.I.T.H. network, where drones will be able to create an event big enough to cover an entire city.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Right, well done. Make sure every drone is weapons hot. We need maximum damage.
Guterman: That's gonna cause a lot of casualties.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Oh, yeah. More casualties, more coverage. I gotta cut through the static. London is a beautiful city and it will suffer, but they can rebuild. If I'm gonna be the next Iron Man, I need to save the world from an Avengers-level threat. But, when its new savior descends...
[The holographic projection of Mysterio flies down and incapsulates Beck like a second skin. His voice is slightly altered and amplified]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: ...all those casualties will be forgotten.
[Mysterio's helmet disappears, Beck directs his attention to Janice, who is working on the real Mysterio suit]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Janice, you'll be in position with a quick change armor, for the victory lap?
Janice: Of course. Do you want to try...
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: No, no. That's...
[The footage becomes slightly distorted around Beck's waving upper arm]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: What's going on with my hand? Why is that happening?
William Ginther Riva: Oh, one of the drones that came back from the plaza was missing a projector. It's fine.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Wait, and you're... You're telling me this, now?
William Ginther Riva: It's one drone. The image will be perfect, I promise.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: That projector is evidence. It's going to tell people what we're doing and how we're doing it. I am trying to fool seven billion people here, including Nick Fury, who happens to be the most paranoid and most dangerous person on the planet.
[Beck seems to get more unhinged as he goes on]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: And if he catches on before I've killed him, then he will put a bullet in my head. And nobody wants a bullet in their head! Right?
[Two drones fly towards Guterman and Victoria]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Right?!
[Two others fly towards William, aiming at his forehead]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: William, can you look at me?
[He does]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Pull up E.D.I.T.H..
E.D.I.T.H.: Hello, Quentin.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Yeah. Hi, honey. I need a level 5 search full resource protocol for this device.
[A map is projected and steadily magnified]
E.D.I.T.H.: Magnifying...
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: There. Search everything going in and out of that building.
E.D.I.T.H.: Located.
[Through video footage, we see how MJ got the projector, took it to the bridge and showed it to Peter]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Shit. (looking back at William, furious) You know William, one day, after I've had to kill Peter Parker because of this... I hope you remember, that his blood is on your hands!
[Quentin walks out.]
[Cut to MJ's hotel room, where Peter frantically closes the window curtains.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I can't believe I gave Beck those glasses! I mean, how could I be that stupid? He's probably spying on me right now or sending a drone to come and kill me.
Michelle / MJ: You had access to killer drones?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah, I didn't really want 'em, especially after I almost killed Brad.
Michelle / MJ: You almost killed Brad?!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Look, I have to call Mr. Fury and tell him that Beck's a fraud, but... I think he tapped my phone.
Michelle / MJ: Okay, so what are you gonna do?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Well, I need my suit and I have to go to Berlin and talk to Mr. Fury in person.
[Peter takes his shirt off in front of MJ, then stops to stare at MJ, clearly embarrassed. After a few awkward seconds, MJ gets the message and turns around while Peter strips down to his underwear and begins to put on the stealth suit. MJ still manages to sneak a peek, however, before the camera pans over to reveal Ned standing in the doorway. The two share a glance -- MJ impassive, Ned panicked.]
[Cut to a wide shot of Peter zipping up the Stealth Suit. He lifts up the eye visors.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Ah! Ned, perfect!
Ned Leeds: The costume looks great! For the costume party, at the... Prince's castle...
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: She knows. I told her.
Michelle / MJ: He didn't tell me. I figured it out.
[Ned hesitates, then slowly nods.]
Ned Leeds: Oh. That's cool.
Michelle / MJ: Like, a long time ago.
Ned Leeds: ...oh.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Look, Mysterio is a fraud.
Ned Leeds: But he- But he saved me and Betty's lives...
Michelle / MJ: No, he's been faking the whole thing with illusion tech.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah, he's using these, like, hologram projectors.
Ned Leeds: Whoa! That's... crazy!
Michelle / MJ: Yeah.
[A beat while Peter and MJ share a glance.]
Ned Leeds: So, you guys were, like... working the case together, or what?
Michelle / MJ: It's been mostly me.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Look, Ned, I need you to call May, get her to call Mr. Harrington, say that she wanted me to stay with family in Berlin until this all blows over, okay?
Ned Leeds: Got it. Easy.
Michelle / MJ: Wow. You guys lie with such ease.
[Ned shrugs.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Gotta go.
[Peter starts to move out, pulling open the window curtains.]
Michelle / MJ: Wait! Ah, wait, wait, wait! The projector. You're gonna need this.
[MJ throws Peter the projector, which he catches.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Don't tell anyone about this, okay? Anyone who knows is in danger.
[With that, Peter jumps out the window. MJ stares after him as the camera slowly pans over to Ned.]
Ned Leeds: So, you know, too. It's cool! Um. I mean, I've known first and I've known longer but it's not a competition...
[Cut to a train station where Peter swings onto the top of a moving train as it pulls out of the station. Cut to a wide shot of the city with the Berliner Fernsehturm in the foreground. The text "Berlin, Germany" is superimposed over the landscape.]
[The train pulls into the station and Peter jumps off, swinging over a crowd before landing in front of a civilian.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Uh, 'scuse me? Do you know where-
Woman: Nacht Monkey!
[The woman runs away.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, wait, I didn't...! Aw, man!
[A black Audi pulls up in front of Peter. The window rolls down to reveal Nick Fury.]
Nick Fury: Get in.
[Peter does so and the car speeds off. Peter pulls off his mask, breathing heavily.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Mr. Fury!
Nick Fury: You've got a lot of explaining to do.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, no, no, listen!
Nick Fury: Wait until we're secure.
[Peter pushes himself back into his seat.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay...
[Peter takes a few deep breaths until Fury clears his throat. He makes a slashing motion across his chest, indicating for Peter to put his seatbelt on.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Right.
[Peter tugs on the seatbelt but finds that it's stuck. After a few attempts at loosening it, Peter tugs on the strap so hard that it finally breaks off. Peter nervously looks over to Fury, who gives him a disappointed look and turns his eye back to the road. The car pulls into the garage of a very fancy looking building.]
[Cut to the inside of a pristine white facility, teeming with staff members who Peter and Fury walk past. S.H.I.E.L.D. has obviously recovered from the events of The Winter Soldier quite well. Peter and Fury enter a conference room where Maria Hill is standing.]
Nick Fury: So... Is there anything you want to tell us about your girlfriend?
Agent Maria Hill: He's talking about E.D.I.T.H.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Look, I know I made a mistake, and I'm sorry, but he is not who you think he is. Beck is a liar. Mysterio, the Elementals, it's all fake. He has some sort of illusion tech, and that's how he tricked you guys and he tricked me into giving him E.D.I.T.H.
[Peter pulls out the projector that MJ recovered and slides it across the table.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: It's a projector. I pulled it off the fire monster in Prague.
Nick Fury: So all that death and destruction we witnessed was caused by this?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, not just this! I think he's using drones.
Nick Fury: Well, if this is true, then Beck's very dangerous and we need to be smart. Who else did you tell about this?
[Peter then senses something]
Nick Fury: Parker? Parker!
Agent Maria Hill: What's wrong?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: It's Beck. He's here.
[He puts his eyepiece back when the hologram starts to disappear, Maria Hill included. The facility is just an abandoned building.]
Nick Fury: (shocked) What? Hill?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, it's just an ill...
[A missile is fired from behind Peter, seemingly hitting and killing Fury]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Fury!
[He looks back and sees one of the weaponized drones. It takes another shot, blasting Peter through the back wall, causing him to fall several floors down. Quentin Beck's voice, amplified, takes center stage. Peter gets surrounded by drones, all pointing lasers at him]
Quentin Beck (vo): Wow, Peter. Wow. I thought we were close. Fury always had to die. But not you.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Stop hiding, Beck!
[Peter shoots some web at one of the drones but misses. Their cloaking devices activate and they disappear, while another illusion gets activated]
Quentin Beck (vo): I tried to help you walk away. Now you're making me do this… do this… do this…
[Everything goes dark. Peter, now in his original Tony Stark suit, looks in horror when lights fall down, revealing a school corridor covered in green smoke. Mysterio walks towards him]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: You told me, you were just a kid.
[Peter shoots his web, but only green smoke sprays out of his hands. Mysterio is then suddenly behind him]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: You told me...
[Peter punches him, only to reveal it's a brick pillar]
Quentin Beck (vo): ...you wanted to run after that girl.
MJ (vo): Help me!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: MJ!
[He runs through a door when he's suddenly on top of the Eiffel Tower. The door breaks loose and falls down. Peter looks to his right and sees MJ, confused and scared]
Michelle / MJ: Peter? What's going on?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I know this isn't real.
[Mysterio then materializes out of the full moon, grabbing MJ by her neck]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Do you, though?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: MJ!
[Mysterio throws her away, Peter dives after her]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: MJ!
[The illusion disappears. Peter hits the floor, MJ's screams still echoing through his head]
Quentin Beck (vo): I don't think you know what's real, Peter... [Echoing] Peter... Peter...
[Several buildings pass Peter at incredible speeds. One of the buildings, with a neon sign that says "Queens" above it, stops before him. Mysterio's gigantic fist then punches through it, sending Peter flying. He flies through the horizon, it shatters like glass. After falling through some webs, the illusion is briefly lifted]
Quentin Beck (vo): (distorted) You need to WAKE UP!
[Peter crashes on top of a car. He gets back on the ground, looking around, breathing anxiously. A dozen of drones then fly out of the windows of the building, the illusion continues. Huge shards of glass fall down, surrounding Peter]
Quentin Beck (vo): I mean, look at yourself.
[When Peter reaches out to touch one of his reflections, the reflection comes to life, grabbing his hand. Dozens of Spider-Men hurl themselves at Peter, pulling his suit away]
Quentin Beck (vo): You are just a scared little kid in a sweatsuit!
[The Spider-Men vanish, Peter is now in his homemade suit. He stands among the ruins of a Captain America statue, right in the center of the shield.]
Quentin Beck (vo): I created Mysterio to give the world someone to believe in.
[The camera focusses on a colossal Mysterio statue]
Quentin Beck (vo): I control the truth! [part of voice lowering down] Mysterio is the truth.
[Mysterio attacks, firing lasers at Spider-Man. He ducks away and grabs Mysterio with his web. He pulls, only for him to disappear, he had pulled a crane down. He avoids the crane, but not the stone arm that falls on top of him while he screams. Peter then stands by Anthony Edward Stark's grave. Yes, it's Tony's full name.]
Quentin Beck (vo): If you were good enough, (softer) maybe Tony would still be alive.
[A mechanized hand bursts out of the ground, trying to grab Peter, who scurries back in fear. The partially decomposed corpse of Tony Stark in an Iron Man suit crawls out of the grave and hovers up. We zoom in on the eye socket, a black widow spider crawls out of it, the eyes transform in several marching Mysterios]
Quentin Beck (echoing): Deep down, you know I'm right.
[Zoom in on one of the eyes on his costume. It opens and Spider-Man then finds himself in a gigantic snow globe, several buildings shoot out of the snow, surrounding him. We zoom out, the snow globe is Mysterio's head, who detaches it from his body]
Quentin Beck (vo): You made your choice, and all you had to do was step aside. And now, you ha-
[Bang! The illusion suddenly vanishes when Quentin, in his mo-cap outfit, falls on his knees. As he falls to the ground, Fury, who shot Quentin, limps towards Peter, who had been lying in a pile of sand. Several operatives drive onto the scene, get out of their cars and surround Beck]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (crawling out of the sand) Fury!
Nick Fury: Beck's people... We're trying to find everyone who could expose him. Who'd you tell?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Eh...
Nick Fury: I know you told someone. So, just tell me...
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay...
Nick Fury: Who did you tell? (raises his voice) Who else did you tell?!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Just Ned and MJ from my class, and maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty, but that's it.
[Nick chuckles and shakes his head.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What?
Nick Fury: You... are so gullible.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What?
Nick Fury: I mean, you're smart as a whip. Just a... [in Quentin's voice] ...sucker.
[The last piece of the illusion is lifted, Nick Fury was Beck the whole time]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: And now all your friends have to die.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Oh, my god!
[The two drones on Quentin's sides project a stream of illusions to scare Peter away]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: It's easy to fool people when they're already fooling themselves. But for what it's worth, Peter... I really am sorry.
[The illusion stops. Peter, confused, gets hit by a train, which drives away into a tunnel]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: E.D.I.T.H.?
E.D.I.T.H.: Yes, Quentin?
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Access files to Peter Parker's class trip. I need them to fly home from London.
[Peter, dazed and bruised by the impact of the train, climbs on the train's side. He enters it and sits down in one of the seats before he falls unconscious.]
[Cut to black.]
[Peter Parker wakes up in a prison cell, an orange football shirt over his chest. He looks to his right to see a Dutch football hooligan]
Dutch Football Hooligan #1: Hi.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (confused) Where am I?
[Another hooligan, sitting to Peter's left, answers]
Dutch Football Hooligan #2: Municipal holding facility.
Dutch Football Hooligan #1: They said they found you unconscious at the train yard. Very dangerous.
Dutch Football Hooligan #3: We gave you the shirt because you seemed a bit cold.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Thanks. You guys are nice. You speak really good English.
All Three: Welcome to the Netherlands.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I'm in the Netherlands right now?
Dutch Football Hooligan #1: Yup.
[Peter stands up and runs to the cell door]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (calling out) Guard?
Dutch Football Hooligan #1: The guard's on a break. Probably talking to his wife.
Dutch Football Hooligan #2: Yeah. She's pregnant.
Dutch Football Hooligan #3: (in Dutch) Oh ja? Wat leuk!
Dutch Football Hooligan #2: (responds in Dutch) Ja, vier weken al.
[Peter breaks the lock with his hand, opens the door and leaves the cell. One of the hooligans stands up and walks to the open door. Peter looks to his left to see the guard wearing the Night Monkey mask. He is indeed talking over the phone to someone]
Guard: Yeah. Yeah. Night Monkey. Yeah.
[Peter leaves the building, the guard directs his attention to the, no longer locked up, hooligans]
Guard: You guys okay?
[The hooligan closes the door. Peter, now outside on a rather stereotypical farmers market, puts the football shirt on. After stepping in something, he makes his way to a cheese farmer]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Excuse me, sir? Can I borrow your phone?
Cheese Farmer: (in Dutch) Ja, zeker.
[He hands Peter his phone]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Everyone's so nice here.
[He thinks about who to call for a bit, before typing in Happy Hogan's cell]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay... Pick up, pick up, pick up... Hey. Hey! Uh... I messed up. I need a... I need a ride. Where am I? Uh... where am I, sir?
Cheese Farmer: (in Dutch) Het is Broek op Langedijk.
[Peter, clearly having difficulty with Dutch pronunciation, asks the cheese farmer for another favor]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hang on, could you say that into there?
Cheese Farmer: Hi, it's Broek op Langedijk.
[Title card: Broek op Langedijk, Netherlands]
Cheese Farmer: Yeah, no problem.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Thanks. (over the phone) Did you get that?
[CUT to a tulip field.]
[Peter is walking between rows of tulips, one pink and one yellow. A roaring sound as the Quinjet appears, landing in front of him as he staggers forward. A door opens and Happy walks down the stairs]
Happy Hogan: Peter? Are you okay?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Happy, is that you?
Happy Hogan: Is it me? Yeah, of course, it's me!
[Peter hesitates, then halts]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Stop! Tell me something only you would know!
Happy Hogan: Only I would know. Uh. You-I-uh, remember when we went to Germany? You pay-per-viewed a video in your room? They didn't list the titles, but I could tell by the price it was an adult film at the front desk. And you didn't know how I knew-
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay! Okay! Fine, it's you, it's you, stop!
[They hug]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: It's so good to see you.
Happy Hogan: Peter, you're going to have to tell me what the hell is going on here.
[Happy is stitching up wounds in Peter's back, clearly causing pain]
Happy Hogan: Okay... hold still. There we go.
[Peter visibly flinches]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Ouch.
Happy Hogan: I thought you had super strength.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: It still hurts.
[Peter flinches again, annoyed]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Happy, come on.
Happy Hogan: All right, relax. Just a few more... there we go.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (Yelling) Oh, my God, Happy!
[Peter slams his fist on the table.]
Happy Hogan: Relax!
[Peter jumps up from his chair.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Don't tell me to relax, Happy! how can I relax when I've messed up so bad? I trusted Beck. Right? I thought he was my friend so I gave him the only thing that Mr. Stark left behind for me and now he's going to kill my friends and half of Europe, so please do not tell me to relax.
[He sits down, silent for a few moments.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I shouldn't shout. I just really miss him.
Happy Hogan: Yeah, I miss him too.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Everywhere I go, I see his face. And the whole world is asking who is going to be the next Iron Man and... I don't know if that's me, Happy. I'm not Iron Man.
Happy Hogan: You're not Iron Man. You're never going to be Iron Man. Nobody can live up to Tony. Not even Tony. Tony was my best friend. And he was a mess. He second-guessed everything he did, he was all over the place. The one thing he did that he didn't second-guess was picking you. I don't think Tony would've done what he did... if he didn't know that you were going to be here after he was gone. Your friends are in trouble. You're all alone. The tech is missing. What are you gonna do about it?
[Peter stands, determined.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I'm gonna kick his ass.
Happy Hogan: No, I mean right now. Specifically, what are we gonna do? Because we've been hovering over a tulip field for the last fifteen minutes.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Right, um... I can't call my friends because he's tracking their phones... uh, give me your phone?
[He walks over to Happy.]
Happy Hogan: My, my cell phone?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah.
Happy Hogan: Okay. Here.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What's your password?
Happy Hogan: Password.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No, what is your password?
Happy Hogan: Password. The word. Spell it out, password.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: You're the head of security and your password is 'password'?
Happy Hogan: Yeah, I don't feel good about it either.
[Peter has pulled up an app where Flash is vlogging.]
Flash Thompson, over the phone: Ello, governor! Cup of tea for you? I'mma be in London soon.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: They're in London.
Happy Hogan: London? Okay.
[He gets up, moving toward the front of the Quinjet]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah. I need a suit!
[Happy turns, a bit of a grin on his face.]
Happy Hogan: Suit?
[Happy turns again and walks forward, pressing some buttons on the ceiling. The Avengers theme makes a welcome cameo while a compartment opens behind Peter. The two turn and make eye contact, Peter smiling, then he turns back toward the compartment and moves toward it. Another small compartment opens as Peter stares at it. A small metal pad descends from a part of the ceiling, and Peter puts his hand on it. Blue lights appear, and he steps back.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay, um... bring up everything you have on Spider-Man.
[Holograms appear, and Peter scrolls through them as Happy watches.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah, open that. Okay. No, no, no...
[He turns around with a holographic web shooter when he notices Happy watching him.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What?
Happy Hogan: Nothing. You take care of the suit, I'll take care of the music.
[Happy presses a few more buttons on the ceiling, the song ‘Back in Black’ by AC/DC comes on.]
Peter Parker, tossing a wrench in the air: Oh, I love Led Zeppelin!
[The plane takes off from the field of tulips, and Peter expands a hologram of the Spider-Man suit.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay, can you pull up my web-shooters?
[A hologram of the web-shooter appears, and Peter pulls out a small part.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Isolate the taser webs and reconfigure and boost the voltage to a factor of... 25 percent, and give me complete manual control over detonation.
[Scene cuts to Nick Fury and Maria Hill walking through the halls of a building.]
Nick Fury: I thought Kree having sleeper cells was top secret information.
Agent Maria Hill: Nick... satellites are picking up an E.M. pulse.
Nick Fury: I thought that was over.
Agent Maria Hill: It's the biggest one yet.
Nick Fury: Where?
Agent Maria Hill: London.
[Cuts to Peter's class, walking through an airport.]
Mr. Harrington: Okay guys, the company set up a city tour, and then we'll grab a bite and head to the airport.
Brad Davis: Is no one else gonna acknowledge how crazy this is?
Mr. Dell: I get it. There's been nothing scientific about this science tour at all.
Brad Davis: No, no, no. I'm talking about Peter. Has no one else here noticed how shady he is? Because I saw him in a bathroom of a rest stop with some woman, in his underwear...
[Ned and MJ exchange glances.]
Brad Davis, continuing: ...and he's always sneaking away! Like back at the opera? Huh? And now what, he's suddenly off the trip? With his family in Berlin? Is no one else here interested in the truth?
[Ned lifts a hand, presumably about to talk, but MJ puts an arm in front of him.]
Michelle / MJ: "The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world."
Brad Davis: George Orwell. Thank you, MJ.
Michelle / MJ: Yeah, well. I mean, since Peter's not here to tell his truth, what about you, Brad? Why do you think it's cool to take pictures of people in the bathroom?
Flash Thompson, clearly recording it: Yeah, dude. What's that about?
Brad Davis: No, no, it wasn't like that! It was... I was just trying to take...
Mr. Harrington: Let's just put all this craziness behind us, and have a nice, peaceful afternoon. "Sounds great, Mr. Harrington," said the class, okay...
[They leave, all except for Mr. Dell and Brad.]
Mr. Dell: I'm gonna be the cool teacher right now... you've got to stop doing that, okay? It is weird. No more photos in the bathroom. Urinal or stalls. Okay?
[Brad, defeated, wipes his nose as Mr. Dell walks away. Cut to the rest of the science team walking toward a double-decker bus from a tour bus company called, "London Sightseers". The Bus Driver is shown outside holding a sign that reads, "MIDTOWN HIGH", and shows Midtown School of Science and Technology's seal.]
Mr. Harrington: Look at this!
Bus Driver: Mr. Harrington. Come on. This is your bus.
Mr. Harrington: We've got a bus all to ourselves!
Bus Driver: Nice to see you all. Come along.
[Kids hand the man some backpacks. They go onto the bus. The bus driver, who is revealed to be Guterman, presses a button on an earpiece in his ear.]
Guterman: I have the kids.
[Cut to Mysterio, flying around the city, before hovering outside a window in front of Nick Fury. Nick Fury, Maria Hill and their team are in a room near the top of The Shard.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: I got here as fast as I could. I did a full perimeter sweep. Nothing.
Nick Fury: Damn it.
Agent Maria Hill: Pulse is spiking.
[Beck turns to fly off.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: I'll take another look.
Nick Fury: Soon as you see something, report. You're all we got, Beck.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: This is what I fear. May God help us, Fury.
[Cuts to Beck standing in his mocap suit, two drones hovering at his side.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: God, help us all.
[A dramatic pause.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Okay, people, no Avengers coming. We're good to go. William, launch the drones.
William Ginther Riva: (behind a computer) Copy that, brother. Drones are entering the atmosphere, weapons hot.
[Cuts to a Stark satellite, releasing hundreds of drones.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Excellent. Janice?
[Janice is steaming the tangible cape of Quentin]
Janice: Still working on the cape.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: You gotta get those wrinkles out in a few hours. I could literally be shaking hands with the Queen. Guterman?
[Guterman drives the bus to a specific location]
Guterman: Almost in position.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Okay, hit it, Victoria.
Victoria: Increasing pulse.
[Cut to Maria Hill on her computer, watching the pulse.]
Agent Maria Hill: Whatever this thing is, it's a hundred times bigger than the previous ones.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: E.D.I.T.H.?
E.D.I.T.H.: Yes, Quentin.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Show me my loose ends.
[Holograms showing Nick Fury and Maria Hill show up, then switch to Betty Brant, MJ, and Ned.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Once the show's going, execute a kill order on my command.
E.D.I.T.H.: Copy.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Alright, start the show. Let’s save the world, people.
[The scene cuts to the tour bus with Mr. Harrington’s class on the Tower Bridge. Everyone is sitting on the top deck. Betty, Ned and MJ are situated at the front of the top deck. Camera moves in as Ned and MJ stand up.]
Michelle / MJ: I don’t like this. Something’s definitely up.
Ned Leeds: You’re an FOS now. “Friend of Spider-Man.” And you have to remember, just stay calm.
[Thunder can be heard rumbling off in the distance. Suddenly, a crash of thunder is heard as Ned and MJ quickly look to their left. Storm clouds begin to descend from the top of a building]
Michelle / MJ: That doesn’t look good.
Ned Leeds: But it’s fake, so there’s nothing to worry about.
[Cut to Guterman.]
Guterman: And the kids are in the kill zone.
[Guterman brakes the bus, gets out of the driver seat, and begins to exit the bus, while holding a flat cap and some papers.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (over radio) Great work, Guterman.
[Guterman opens the bus door and exits the bus. The door closes. He puts on the flat cap.]
[Cut to Nick Fury. His phone buzzes.]
Nick Fury: What?
Happy Hogan: Uh... Happy here. Happy Hogan here.
Nick Fury: I know. What do you want?
Happy Hogan: Over at Mr. Stark’s, going through his belongings. Apparently, there was a surfboard that you left behind.
Nick Fury: What?
Happy Hogan: People over there said they didn’t think Nick Fury was a surfer, but I said: “Appearances can be deceiving.”
Nick Fury: It’s not mine. And don’t ever call this number again.
[Nick Fury hangs up furious. He turns his head and looks at Maria Hill. He holds his gaze for a moment and looks back toward the window.]
[The scene cuts to a coastal region. The Stark Industries Private Jet flies over the area. The text “DORSET COAST, UNITED KINGDOM.” is superimposed on the landscape.]
Happy Hogan: Okay. Fury’s got the coded message. Your friends are at the Tower Bridge.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay.
Happy Hogan: Your boy called it the London Bridge, but I figured it out. I’mma go scoop them up, okay?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah.
Happy Hogan: We’re close.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: We’re close.
Happy Hogan: How’s the suit comin’?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Almost done.
Happy Hogan: Good.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. Before you go…
[Peter pulls out the Black Dahlia necklace]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: If something happens to me, could you please give this to MJ?
Happy Hogan: You’re gonna make it back. You’ll give it to her yourself. ‘Kay? You got this.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I got this.
Happy Hogan: Now walk me through it.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (taking a deep breath) I know it’s illusion tech, right?
Happy Hogan: Mhm.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: All I have to do is get on the inside of the illusion, then I can take it down, find him, and he’s just a guy, so I can take E.D.I.T.H. right back.
Happy Hogan: Right, but last time, you got hit by a train.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: True, but this time… how do I explain this? Uh… I have like a sixth sense.
Happy Hogan: The Peter-tingle. That’s what you’re talking about, right?
[Peter looks visibly annoyed by the mention of Peter-tingle. It’s clear that Aunt May told Happy about the Peter-tingle.]
Happy Hogan: It’s not working, though. I heard it wasn’t working right now. Is it?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: It is working. Well, I don’t… I don’t know if it’s working...
Happy Hogan: Good, so you got the Peter-tingle. That’s the plan. I’m gonna go get your friends. You get that Peter-tingle back online.
[Happy Hogan runs back to the cockpit.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I got this. I got this.
[The Spider-Man suit is still in the process of being made as the outer layer is currently being applied. We see a close-up of the eye lenses being constructed rapidly by several mechanical arms. Finally, the spider logo is inserted by a mechanical arm.]
[We cut back to an aerial view of the Tower Bridge as the storm moves closer.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (to William) Cue the lightning.
William Ginther Riva: (behind a computer) Cuing lightning.
[William presses ENTER on his computer.]
[We cut back to Ned and MJ on the bus. The storm has nearly surrounded the Tower Bridge and lightning hits the top of the structure, causing sparks to fly out. Ned and MJ look toward where the lightning came from. Shouts and screams can be heard in the distance. The wind begins to pick up and thunder crashes can be heard. Mr. Harrington walks down to the first deck of the bus and makes his way to the driver’s seat.]
Mr. Harrington: Sir, is it still safe on the top, or should we all-
[Mr. Harrington realizes that there’s no bus driver to be found.]
Mr. Harrington: -come down? Oh, my.
[Cut to a bird’s eye view of the tour bus. The rest of the class is looking at the storm and are all worried. Mr. Harrington walks up to the top deck, panicked.]
Mr. Dell: What did the bus driver say?
Mr. Harrington: Bus driver’s gone.
Everyone in the class, except Mr. Harrington: What?!
Unidentified female student: Where?!
Mr. Harrington: It’s okay. Mr. Dell and I have it under control! Okay?
Mr. Dell: No, no, no. Don’t drag me into this, Roger.
Mr. Harrington: I’m doing my best, Julius!
[A giant mass of water in the Thames River near the Tower Bridge rises up.]
Mr. Dell: Oh! The witches are back.
[Mr. Harrington turns and realizes that it’s an Elemental.]
Mr. Harrington: Oh, my God, get off the bus!
[Mr. Harrington and the rest of his class quickly rush down the stairs to the second deck and out of the bus.]
[We cut to an aerial view of the Tower Bridge. The road on both sides is jammed as everyone has abandoned their vehicles. Debris is flying around and sparks and smoke can be seen on the roads. People are running in both directions off the bridge. Three cyclones of water are seen emerging from the River.]
[We cut back to Mr. Harrington’s class. They have exited the bus. A motorcycle zips by Mr. Harrington, causing him to halt briefly.]
Mr. Harrington: Okay. Okay, follow me, kids.
[Screams can be heard. Lightning strikes a nearby vehicle, sending sparks out. Students follow their teacher. Flash attempts to capture everything that’s happening around him on his livestream. Some people are seen exiting their vehicles. Betty Brant and Ned hold hands as they run away. MJ is following behind them. A lightning strikes their tour bus, tipping it over and spewing debris, sparks, and smoke in all directions. A water cyclone grabs hold of the tour bus and destroys it causing a massive explosion. The camera pans upward, revealing the face of the Elemental as it loudly roars.]
[We cut to Quentin Beck in one of the upper walkways of the Tower Bridge. He looks toward the Elemental with a smile.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Now, that is an Avengers-level threat.
[We cut to a view of the Tower Bridge on the ground. There are three cyclones that seem to be a mix of the Fire, Earth, Air, and Water Elementals. The wind is violent and there are sparks and debris flying through the air. People are running away from the Bridge. The roars of the Elemental are heard. Something is shown to be moving just under the surface of the River. They are revealed to be drones. Three drones are shown. The drones send sonic waves which smash into some walls around the River. A streetlight and the walls break, sending them into the River.]
[We cut to Mr. Harrington’s class, as he directs them away from the Bridge. Many other people are running away in various directions.]
Mr. Harrington: This way. This way!
[Flash is shown trying to capture everything on camera. He points his phone’s camera up in the sky.]
Flash Thompson: Okay. Okay.
Ned Leeds: Flash!
Mr. Dell: Follow that cursed hand.
[MJ and Mr. Dell come into frame and get Flash to continue running away.]
[Mr. Harrington and his class continue to run away. Guterman is shown, leaning against a wall. Guterman notices the class.]
Mr. Harrington: This way, kids. Follow me.
Ned Leeds: It’s not real, it’s not real!
Michelle / MJ: Well it looks pretty real to me!
[We see another angle of the Tower Bridge and the Elemental, which has fully materialized.]
Mr. Harrington: Follow me, kids!
Mr. Dell: Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water. Oh no. They joined forces like the Power Rangers!
[The entire class stops to watch the Elemental, while in the background, we see many people running away.]
Mr. Harrington: You’re thinking of Voltron.
Mr. Dell: Who?
Mr. Harrington: Voltron! You’re thinking of Voltron!
[Brad suddenly notices something and becomes excited.]
Brad Davis: Hey, look, it’s Mysterio!
[Mysterio is shown flying toward the Elemental from the sky.]
Brad Davis: He’s gonna save us!
[The class is elated and cheers for Mysterio. Mysterio shoots a green laser beam at the Elemental’s head.]
[We cut to a shot of Betty, Ned, and MJ. MJ looks worried.]
Michelle / MJ: (to Ned) Wait, Mysterio knows we know…
Ned Leeds: Then we’re in danger.
Michelle / MJ: Yeah, and so are they. (to Everyone) We should go!
[Betty, Ned and MJ quickly run away. Flash is recording the attack when he notices them leaving and quickly follows them.]
Mr. Dell: Kill that witch! Pa-pow!
[Mysterio shoots a green laser beam at the chest of the Elemental. The Elemental attempts to crush Mysterio with its hands, however Mysterio creates a green force field, fouling its efforts. The force field explodes and Mysterio flies upwards, away from its grasp.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: This is for my family!
[Mysterio sends a green beam that splits into various laser beams that impact the right side of the head of the Elemental.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (to Fury, through radio, acting panicked) You should get somewhere safe, Fury. I don’t see this ending well.
Nick Fury: I appreciate your concern, but I never leave my men behind.
[We cut to the Stark Industries Private Jet flying into frame from the right side of the camera. We see Happy Hogan in the cockpit, flying the jet.]
Happy Hogan: All right, comms check. Can you hear me, kid?
[Peter in his upgrade Spider-Man suit is shown on the outside plane on the left side of the cockpit.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah, I can. It’s just a little loud out here.
Happy Hogan: I like the new suit.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Thanks.
Happy Hogan: (noticing the Elemental from a distance) Whoa, Peter, you sure that’s not real?
[A large storm cloud surrounding the Tower Bridge is shown from far away.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah, it’s just a hundred times bigger than I expected.
Happy Hogan: Still the play?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Uh-huh. We need to get high enough so Beck doesn’t see me coming.
[The Jet begins to ascend in altitude.]
Happy Hogan: Copy. Stay sticky.
[The Jet rises vertically right next to the Elemental.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hey, Happy.
Happy Hogan: Yeah, kid. What is it?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: We need to have a serious conversation about you and my aunt!
[Peter isn’t able to finish the word “aunt” before he lets go of the plane, falling toward the Elemental from above.]
[Peter is flipping through air and falling from the sky. He engages his parachute and dives toward the Elemental.]
[We cut to the Elemental and Mysterio fighting. Fury attempts to reach Beck.]
Nick Fury: Beck, report!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (to Guterman, through radio) Hey, Guterman, I need a… I need a response. Something quick and decisive.
Guterman: “It’s all the Elementals. They’re somehow merged into something...”
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (acting out of breath) … into something else. Something more powerful. It’s drawing energy from the Earth’s core.
[Nick Fury senses that something is off as what Beck is saying makes no sense at all. He turns to Maria Hill.]
Nick Fury: (to Maria) See, now, that’s some bullshit.
[Maria Hill sighs. She notices something up in the sky and begins walking toward the window.]
Agent Maria Hill: Is that…?
[Nick Fury notices it too. It’s revealed to be Spider-Man. Spider-Man is diving toward the Elemental from above.]
Nick Fury: Be ready for anything.
[Nick Fury is looking toward the sky at Spider-Man. He turns to look at Hill]
Agent Maria Hill: Yeah.
[Spider-Man drops low enough and ejects his parachute and uses his web wings to glide toward the Elemental illusion.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Ah. It’s not real, it’s not real, it’s not real!
[Peter enters the illusion, crashes into one of the combat drones that was projecting the Elemental and holds onto it, looking all over in awe at the illusion.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (in awe) Whoa. That’s awesome.
[Peter witnesses hundreds of drones projecting the Elemental.]
[Maria Hill opens a hatch that leads to the roof of their tower and pushes a black case up onto the roof. Maria Hill climbs the ladder and reaches the roof. We see an aerial view of the top of the tower.]
[Peter uses his webbing to stick onto the drone he was holding on. He flips onto another drone, linking them with his webbing. He flips from one drone to the next, continuing to link them with his webbing.]
[We cut back to Quentin Beck.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: William, I've got drones breaking formation.
William Ginther Riva: Well, maybe they hit a flock of birds or something. You're fine.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Well, I wanna see what's going on there. I'm taking manual control.
[From within the massive Elemental illusion, a drone turns around. From his wrist screen, Beck sees Peter webbing up the drones.]
William Ginther Riva: (over radio) Do you see anything?
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Yeah. And I'm gonna kill him.
[Peter links a combat drone with two webs and jumps off the drone and shoots and another web, which attaches to it.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I hope this works.
[Peter presses his spider logo, which is a button that sets off his taser webbing, sending electricity to all the drones that he managed to link. The drones begin to malfunction and they are surging with electricity. Peter lands on top of a combat drone and sees that the illusion begins to fall apart. Parts of the Elemental and Mysterio’s green smoke trail begin to disappear and hundreds of drones can be seen. A combat drone de-cloaks in front of Nick Fury.]
Nick Fury: (to Hill) You got me?
[Maria Hill fires a rocket launcher at the drone, saving Nick Fury’s life. The drone is blown up and its debris falls.]
Agent Maria Hill: Yeah, I got you.
[Cut to Quentin Beck.]
William Ginther Riva: (over radio) Boss, the illusion is coming apart.
[Cut to Peter in the illusion on top of a drone. The illusion is coming apart. Peter notices Beck in the Tower Bridge upper walkway. Beck notices him too.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I see you.
[Peter begins flipping onto drones, charging toward Beck.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: E.D.I.T.H., give me some protection.
E.D.I.T.H.: Copy.
[Peter leaps toward Beck's location, when suddenly, a combat drone slams into him. He slams into the outer wall of the other upper walkway and falls down to the ground. Peter attempts to shoot his webs to prevent himself from slamming into the ground. However, he's too late and falls onto the Bridge's railing, which separates the street and the sidewalk. The railing breaks. Peter, in pain, coughs and his right hand covers his lower left rib cage to ease the pain. Peter looks up to see hundreds of drones gathering.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: 'Kay, kill it, just kill the illusion, kill it...
William Ginther Riva: No, I'm not gonna kill it, they'll see!
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: They'll see what I want them to see!
Janice: Do you still need the cape?
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Yes, Janice, I still need the cape.
[William clicks a button on his keyboard.]
William Ginther Riva: Done.
[At the Tower Bridge, the illusion of Mysterio and the mega Elemental disappear.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Now, William? Render my illusion suit.
William Ginther Riva: Alright, hang on!
[The scene cuts to Happy inside the Quinjet holding a phone showing a video recording of Flash Thompson.]
Flash Thompson (vo): The monster was full of drones. It's crazy!
Happy Hogan: There you are. (The Quinjet flies by to land in on a riverside.)
Happy Hogan: Easy.
[The Quinjet slowly lands to the ground.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (noticing the Quinjet) Who the hell is that?
Happy Hogan: Ned!
Ned Leeds: Happy!
Happy Hogan: I got to get you guys out of here! Get on the jet!
Michelle / MJ: Who are you?
Happy Hogan: I work with Spider-Man, okay? You got to get on that jet.
Flash Thompson: You work for Spider-Man?
Happy Hogan: I work with Spider-Man, not for Spider-Man!
[The Jet explodes after getting hit from drone's missiles]
Happy Hogan: New plan. Into the tower!
[Peter notices the explosion of the Jet.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Happy, are you okay?
Happy Hogan: Yeah. We're okay. Just go get Beck.
[Cut to Beck]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: E.D.I.T.H., target Spider-Man.
E.D.I.T.H.: Copy.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: I'll just kill the kids myself.
[The combat drones begin mobilizing and start firing at Peter. Peter runs away, evading bullet fire and explosions. Peter jumps away, swinging around Tower Bridge.]
[Beck looks at a screen and spots Happy, Ned, MJ, Betty and Flash running toward the Tower.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: There you are.
[Two combat drones are shown to be pursuing them, descending from above.]
Happy Hogan: Into the Crown Jewels vault!
[The group follows Happy. In the background, we see two Queen’s Guards firing at the incoming drones.]
Happy Hogan: Yeah, go, go, go!
Michelle / MJ: Come on.
[The Queen’s Guards manage to destroy one, however the other quickly zips by.]
Ned Leeds: Go!
Happy Hogan: Into the vault! The walls are 8 feet thick. Go into the vault!
Michelle / MJ: What?
Happy Hogan: Into the vault. Go!
[The drone begins firing and breaks through glass walls. The glass shatters onto the ground. The group ducks and continues running toward the vault. The drone fires and shatters some of the glass cases with various medieval artifacts, such as armor, put on exhibition.]
Happy Hogan: Take cover!
[Ned and Betty take cover on one side of the room next to a window with an armor stand that has been decorated with armor. MJ, Flash, and Happy take cover on the opposite side of the room. The drone enters the room and scans the area. Beck, who is in control of the drone, slowly moves the drone forward. The drone continues to look around for the kids. An out-of-breath MJ notices a morning star, a medieval weapon consisting of a shaft with an attached ball adorned with many spikes.]
Michelle / MJ: (whispering to herself) Okay.
[Happy gestures to stay quiet. MJ reaches for the morning star.]
Michelle / MJ: (whispering to Happy) Yeah?
Happy Hogan: (mouthing) No. No.
[MJ disregards Happy’s protest and lifts the morning star from the grasp of the armor. Underestimating the weight of it once she grabs it, her arms drop and the weapon almost hits the ground, which would’ve given away their location to Beck. Happy and Flash are both wince, anticipating the large noise that would’ve been produced had the weapon slammed into the ground. Flash covers his mouth and he gasps in shock.]
[Beck notices sound coming from Flash, Happy and MJ’s location.]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: I see you.
[The drone’s gatling gun cycles around and advances. Flash has his phone out as he tries to capture the drone on camera. Happy gets him to stop.]
Happy Hogan: (whispering, to Flash) Get that thing out.
[Betty and Ned push over armor with a halberd. The drone begins firing at the armor on the ground. MJ takes this opportunity while the drone is preoccupied and bashes it the morning star.]
Michelle / MJ: Go!
[Everyone begins running toward the vault. Happy grabs a metal shield. The drone is disoriented and begins firing upward in a circle. The group gets inside the vault. One door closes and Happy throws his shield while closing the other, however it misses.]
Happy Hogan: How does Cap do that?
[The drone starts firing at the vault doors, but the vault is already sealed. Beck frowns from this setback. He activates a laser beam and decides to begin cutting open the thick vault door.]
[We cut to the Tower Bridge where many drones are firing at Peter. Vehicles are blown up and Peter flips behind a taxi car to take cover. The drones shoot through the taxi windows.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Happy, say something, to let me know you’re alive!
Happy Hogan: (over radio) I’m here. I’m here.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Oh Happy, thank God.
Happy Hogan: I bought us some time.
[The drone begins using the laser beam to cut through the vault door.]
Happy Hogan: But not much.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (over radio) I’m trying to get to Beck...
[Cut to the Bridge.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: ...but I can’t shake these drones!
---This part is not finished. We will be pleased if you help us complete the transcript. - SpringsterR.317 (Minor Editor of fixers for the Marvel Transcripts)---
[Three more drones join the drone that is cutting through the vault door. We cut to the group standing in front of the door. ]
Ned Leeds: Are we gonna die?
Happy Hogan: Nobody dies on my watch.
[The new drones send sonic waves toward the door in order to weaken the structure. Dust and debris fall from the ceiling. The group becomes more worried.]
Ned Leeds: I wasted my life playing video games, and we’re gonna die.
Betty Brant: I have a fake ID, and I’ve never even used it.
Flash Thompson: I post stupid videos daily for people to like me.
Happy Hogan: (to Flash) Hey, if it wasn't for those stupid videos, Spider-Man would have never found you.
Flash Thompson: Spider-Man…? Spider-Man follows me? I saved us, guys!
Michelle / MJ: If you saved us, then why are we about to die?!
Betty Brant: MJ!
Happy Hogan: Stop it!
Michelle / MJ: I’m sorry, okay? It’s just, I’m obsessed with telling the truth even if it hurts other people’s feelings.
Happy Hogan: (admitting embarrassingly) I’m in love with Spider-Man’s aunt.
[Everyone else looks at him puzzled.]
Happy Hogan: We’re sharing, right?
---This part is not finished. We will be pleased if you help us complete the transcript. :) - SpringsterR.317 (Minor Editor of fixers for the Marvel Transcripts)---
[A portion of the vault door has been cut through and that portion falls out. Ned, Betty, MJ and Flash duck in an attempt to shield themselves from the drone. Happy gets ready to shield and protect them. Peter breaks through the glass under the upper walkway and sticks the ceiling of the hallway, grabbing hold of Beck by Beck's motion-capture suit and punching a hole through his glass helmet. This deactivates the drones, which were ready to fire on the group in the vault.]
[Spider-Man has Beck right where he wants him, holding him in the air by the broken helmet]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Your lies are over, Beck.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (not worried) This certainly isn't ideal, but... I have contingencies. E.D.I.T.H.?
[A drone shoots Peter to the other end of the corridor. Beck lands on his feet]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (getting back up) Just give me the glasses.
[Beck pulls E.D.I.T.H. out of his motion-capture suit]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: You want these? Come and get them.
[The drones activate their cloaking mechanism and the projection system. The corridor turns dack and green mist flows over the floor]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (taking a deep breath) Come on, Peter-tingle.
[He closes his eyes and goes for it. He jumps all across the corridor, destroying drone after drone and coming closer and closer to the villain]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (while pressing buttons) Why aren't these drones firing?
E.D.I.T.H.: You're in the strike zone. The chance of getting hit...
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (losing it) No, FIRE... ALL THE DRONES... NOOOOOOOOOW!
[The drones behind him fly forward and activate their weapons. Peter knocks his way through them. During the fight, one of the drones is spun around and Beck is hit in the chest by a rogue bullet. After all the drones are destroyed, Peter steps towards her former friend, taking off his mask]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Beck! Beck... You lied to me. I trusted you.
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: I know. That's the most... disappointing part. You're a good person, Peter. Such a weakness...
[Quentin takes the glasses and hands them towards Peter]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Stark was right. You do deserve that.
[Peter grabs something to his right. BANG! He turns his head as the Quentin he'd been talking to vanishes. The real Quentin drops his gun, lightly spasming]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: You can't trick me anymore.
[Peter grabs the glasses off of Quentin's head as he falls to the ground]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: E.D.I.T.H., turn off the drones.
E.D.I.T.H.: Biometric scan complete. Welcome back, Peter. Shall I execute all cancellation protocols?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Do it. Execute them all.
E.D.I.T.H.: Confirmed.
[All the drones fly back up to the satellite. Maria Hill watches from afar. We briefly cut to the vault]
Happy Hogan: Give me the spear.
[While the weapon is passed over...]
Ned Leeds: That's a halberd.
[Back to Peter]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Thank you.
[His face hardens as he turns to the dying Beck, lying on the ground]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: How could you do all of this?
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: (whispering) You'll see, Peter. People need to believe... And nowadays... they'll believe anything.
[The con man doesn't move anymore. He appears to be dead]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (to E.D.I.T.H.) Is he... Is this real?
E.D.I.T.H.: All illusions are down, Peter.
[Peter takes off his glasses and continues staring at a deceased Quentin Beck. We then cut to William, who checks his phone. He has successfully downloaded the projection and removes a USB drive and closes his laptop.]
[We cut to the Crown Jewels Vault. The group opens the vault doors, still cautious of any lingering signs of danger. Flash breaks the silence.]
Flash Thompson: Whoo! Yeah!
[MJ begins running toward the Tower Bridge, in search of Peter.]
Happy Hogan: Hey, where’re you going?
[Cut to an aerial view of the Tower Bridge, with small fires and smoke throughout. Sirens can be heard faintly in the background. MJ is walking on the Bridge. She sees Peter and begins running to him. Peter is limping and grunting in pain, walking on the Bridge as well.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: MJ.
Michelle / MJ: Hey. Hey.
[MJ runs toward Peter and throws the morning star to the side and embraces Peter.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hey.
Michelle / MJ: Are you okay?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I’m okay. Are you okay?
Michelle / MJ: Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Is everybody else okay?
Michelle / MJ: Yeah, everyone’s okay.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: What happened?
Michelle / MJ: There was just the drones, and they were following us, and then, then they just stopped. Pauses Was that you?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah.
[They stop hugging.]
Michelle / MJ: Did you get him?
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Nods Yeah…
Michelle / MJ: Well, I uh… brought that. (pointing at the morning star) In case, you needed some help. Anyway, uh, there was this sweaty guy in the tower with us. I think he like works for you or something. He um… He gave me this.
[MJ pulls out of her pocket the Black Dahlia necklace but it’s broken. Peter is distraught at the state of the necklace]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No. No. Oh, MJ, I’m so sorry. I had this plan, this stupid plan.
Michelle / MJ: Peter…
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: And I wrote it all down, I was gonna buy you this and give it to you in Paris at the top-
[MJ kisses Peter on the lips. Peter is very confused. MJ smiles.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: And you kissed me. What? What?
Michelle / MJ: I don’t really have much luck when it comes to getting close to people. Um… so I lied. I wasn’t just watching you ‘cause I thought you were Spider-Man.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: That’s great.
Michelle / MJ: Black Dahlia, like-
Both (Peter and MJ): The murder.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah.
Michelle / MJ: Good.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Sorry it’s broken.
Michelle / MJ: I actually like it better broken.
[MJ smiles.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I really like you.
Michelle / MJ: I really like you too.
[Peter and MJ kiss once briefly. The music swells and they go in for a more prolonged kiss.]
Michelle / MJ: (Chuckling) ‘Kay. I should um… I should probably get back to the class.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I’ll go and… Yeah. I don’t know.
Michelle / MJ: Okay.
[MJ picks up the morning star.]
Michelle / MJ: Just in case.
[MJ walks away, looking back at Peter. Both of them smile at each other. Peter walks off happy that he now has a girlfriend. Peter exits the scene and walks toward the other side of the Bridge.]
[Cut to a view of the Tower Bridge from a dock along the Thames River.]
Happy Hogan: (on the phone) Yeah, no. No, May, you’re right. He did great. He was strong. Yeah. I’m glad he stayed too. (Noticing Nick Fury and Maria Hill walking toward him) Uh, I gotta go.
[Happy hangs up.]
Happy Hogan: Well, I’m glad you’re alive. I guess the coded message worked.
Nick Fury: “Appearances can be deceiving.” (Chuckles) I’m surprised you didn’t just wink in the camera.
Happy Hogan: It worked.
Nick Fury: Only because I had serious doubts about Beck from the beginning.
Agent Maria Hill: Not true. He had zero doubts.
[Nick Fury looks at Hill.]
Nick Fury: Where’s Parker?
Happy Hogan: He’s with a girl.
Nick Fury: I need to speak with him.
Happy Hogan: He’ll call you.
Nick Fury: He’ll call…?
[Nick Fury begins laughing and looks to Hill. Hill looks barely able to keep in her laughter.]
Nick Fury: Okay. Great. But, he better. Or it’s your ass. And don’t even think about ghosting me.
[Nick Fury turns his head and quickly turns his head back to Happy, who is also holding an intense stare. The song ‘I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend,’ by the American punk rock band the Ramones, begins playing near the end of the scene and continues playing in the following scene.]
[Scene begins with Peter and MJ holding hands, walking through Newark Liberty International Airport. We cut to a shot of the families of various students on the field trip greeting their return home. One family is holding a sign which reads “Welcome Home” and another sign reads “We missed you!”. The text "NEWARK, NEW JERSEY" is superimposed over the shot. We cut back to Peter and MJ as they stop for a moment.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Are you sure no one else has figured it out?
Michelle / MJ: Yeah, I mean, it’s not like anybody really pays attention to you.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Ouch.
Michelle / MJ: Except for...me.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Aww. Thanks.
Michelle / MJ: Don’t be late.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I won’t. See you later.
[MJ leaves. Betty and Ned walk up to Peter.]
Betty Brant: You guys are so cute.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Thanks. Uh… I was thinking we should all… I don’t know, like go on a double date or something.
Betty Brant and Ned Leeds: Oh, we broke up.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No. Wh-What? Why?
Ned Leeds: Men and women grow apart, but the journey they share together will always be a part of them.
[Betty places her right hand on Ned’s left cheek.]
Betty Brant: You are so wise.
Ned Leeds: Thank you.
[Betty Brant walks off. Peter gives Ned a puzzled look. Ned shrugs with a smile.]
[Flash walks toward his chauffeur.]
Flash Thompson: Hello, Gerald. Could Mother not make it?
[Gerald shakes his head.]
Flash Thompson: Oh.
[Flash looks off, clearly troubled by this.]
[Cut to Peter exiting the airport. Peter stops to look around and notices Aunt May.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: May!
May Parker: (to a security guard) I promise you… (noticing Peter) Oh, he’s here. Don’t give me a ticket.
[Peter and Aunt May hug.]
May Parker: So glad you’re okay.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: No. For real, I'm good. I'm actually really... fine.
May Parker: Let’s go. Where are your bags? Oh, right. they got blown up.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Yeah.
[Peter and Aunt May start walking toward their car. Aunt May hands a brown paper bag to Peter]
May Parker: I got you some hot buttered bagels.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Thank you so much.
May Parker: I know my boy
Peter Parker (vo): I kept my identity pretty guarded this past couple years. I faced a lot of deception. And I’m tired of the lies.
[Peter is shown to be in his house, in his Spider-Man suit, talking to Aunt May and Happy.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: So it’s time for the truth to be out there. (Pauses) Are you dating?
Happy Hogan: Yes.
May Parker: (at the same time as Happy) Not really.
[Aunt May and Happy look at each other, surprised by their differing response to Peter’s question. Throughout the scene, Aunt May and Happy talk at the same time.]
Happy Hogan: What?
May Parker: Well…
Happy Hogan: I think…
May Parker: Summer fling…
Happy Hogan: Yes, that evolves and grows like any other.
May Parker: I still don’t know where it’s going to go.
Happy Hogan: Open to wherever it might lead.
May Parker: Anywhere.
Happy Hogan: And to share it with people-
May Parker: On or off. But we’ll always be friends no matter what.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: I’m gonna go because I’ve got a date.
May Parker: And we’ll always have these memories.
Happy Hogan: -who are also part of a unit…
May Parker: Yeah.
Happy Hogan: … because we all are interconnected.
[Peter shoots a web to grab his Spider-Man mask.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Bye.
May Parker: We are.
[Peter leaves.]
[Cut to Peter swinging through New York City. Peter takes a few selfies while swinging. Peter swings to the side of an office building and runs on its windows.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (to the people in the office) Sorry!
[Peter reads the messages in his chatroom with MJ. There are two messages, one from Peter and one from MJ. Peter’s message reads “On my way :) 2 min” and MJ’s message reads “Don’t text and swing!”. Peter realizes there’s a bus in front of him]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Whoa!
[Peter narrowly avoids slamming into a bus by flipping onto the bus. He lets go of his phone and catches it while flipping. He performs a backflip and shoots a web toward a building and continues swinging through the city.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Whoo!
[Peter swings to the rooftop of a tall building. He shoots his webbing to the top of the building and runs on the side of the rooftop. Peter jumps off of the edge of the building, diving straight into the air. Peter glides through the air with his web wings.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Woo-hoo!
[Peter glides through a new opening in the middle of the former Avengers Tower, from behind the front of Grand Central Terminal. Peter lands on a street pole and spins around to slow down and plants his feet to meet MJ.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Hey.
Michelle / MJ: Hey.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Sorry I’m late.
Michelle / MJ: It’s fine.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: You ready?
Michelle / MJ: Yeah.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: You’re gonna love this.
[We cut to Peter and MJ swinging across New York. MJ has her arms around Peter and she is frightened of the speed and height they are swinging at.]
Michelle / MJ: Ohh-kay! Okay! Okay!
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: You ready?
Michelle / MJ: Yeah. I’m just not gonna watch. I’m not gonna watch. I’m not gonna watch. I should stop looking. I’m gonna stop looking!
[Peter and MJ continue to swing through New York. They swing over New York Public Library where they begin to descend quickly. MJ screams in terror as they hold hands in the air.]
[Credits roll. The song ‘Vacation’ by the all-female rock band, The Go-Go's, is played.]
*****
[Mid-credits scene]
Michelle / MJ: Okay, you can put me down now! You can put me down now!
[The two of them land in the middle of New York City, in front of Madison Square Garden.]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: You okay?
[She stumbles back, lightly disoriented]
Michelle / MJ: Uh... Whoo… Yeah! Yeah, I'm okay. Just.... Never, never doing that again. I'm never doing that again.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: Okay. Well, I should probably get out of here.
Michelle / MJ: Be safe.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: See you later.
[Spider-Man jumps onto a nearby lamp post.]
Voice: This is breaking news.
[The camera pans around the superhero towards an enormous television screen, showing a news broadcast]
Pat Kiernan: We come to you now with revelations about last week's attack in London. An anonymous source provided this video, it shows Quentin Beck, a.k.a., Mysterio, moments before his death. A warning, you may find this video disturbing.
[Cut to altered footage of the Tower Bridge battle. Mysterio's theme plays in the background]
Mysterio: I managed to send the Elemental back into the dimensional rift, but I don't think I'm gonna make it off this bridge alive. Spider-Man attacked me for some reason. He has an army of weaponized drones, Stark technology. He's saying he's the only one who's gonna be the new Iron Man, no one else.
[We're shown Quentin's death, but his superhero costume has been digitally added. The audio is different, too]
E.D.I.T.H.: Are you sure you want to commence the drone attack? There will be significant casualties.
Spider-Man: Do it! Execute them all!
[We hear the sound of drones firing and people screaming. While Peter and MJ watch, the newscaster comes back on screen]
Pat Kiernan: This shocking video was released earlier today on the controversial news website, 'TheDailyBugle.net.'
[Cut to J. Jonah Jameson on the news screen, played by the one and only J.K. Simmons]
J. Jonah Jameson: There you have it, folks: conclusive proof that Spider-Man was responsible for the brutal murder of Mysterio! An interdimensional warrior who gave his life to protect our planet, and who will no doubt go down in history as the greatest superhero of all time. But that's not all, folks. Here's the real blockbuster. Brace yourselves, you might wanna sit down.
[Cut back to altered footage of the Tower Bridge battle]
Quentin Beck / Mysterio: Spider-Man's real... Spider-Man's real name is... Spider-Man's name is Peter Parker!
[Peter's school picture fills the screen. Cut to Peter]
Peter Parker / Spider-Man: (horrified) WHAT THE FU??!
[Cut right then and there to the credits going by with Michael Giacchino's killer score behind them. Once they've finished, we cut to a car being driven by Nick Fury, with Maria Hill sitting next to him. Their eyes briefly meet, before Maria Hill transforms into a Skrull, Soren, last seen in Captain Marvel]
Soren: You've got to tell him.
[Nick Fury transforms into Talos, also from Captain Marvel]
General Talos: (trying to comfort his wife) It was fine. The little boy handled it, we helped...
Soren: Talos.
General Talos: (annoyed) Come on, Soren, how was I supposed to know the whole thing was fake? I mean, that was all very, very convincing, you know. The performances, the illusion, that costume, the craftsmanship in that. I mean, this is just embarrassing for a shape-shifter. Fine!
[While driving, he pulls out a smartphone to contact Fury. During the call, we see Talos in a POV shot, mimicking a phone camera]
General Talos: Hey there. I hope your mission is going well. We gave the glasses to Parker, about a week ago, like you said. And, uh, it was very touching, you know? Really, really quite touching.
Soren: Talos.
General Talos: And, uh, you know, shortly after that, everything kind of went off the rails, and so we need you to come back. Because everyone kept asking me where the Avengers are, and I don’t know what to say to that.
[We cut to the real Nick Fury, resting on a beach, lying in a chair with a coconut drink next to him]
General Talos: So, you’re lucky-
[Nick ends the call. He gets up and stretches out while the beach disappears, merely a hologram. He leaves a room, revealing that he is on a spaceship with several Skrulls. He walks to a huge window, showing the immensity of space]
Nick Fury: (claps his hands) Everybody, back to work! Who's got my shoes?
[The last message shows a "dedicated to" message for Spider-Man's creators, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. After that, the movie ends]
[Closing title 1: Sony]
[Closing title 2: Columbia Pictures A Columbia Pictures Release A Sony Company]
The End.
