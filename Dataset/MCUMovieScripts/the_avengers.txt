"And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a common threat. On that day, the Avengers were born--to fight the foes no single superhero could withstand! Through the years, their roster has prospered, changing many times, but their glory has never been denied! Heed the call, then--for now, the Avengers Assemble!"
[BURNING BLUE FLAMES. A smoky cube shape emerges - THE TESSERACT. Filling the screen with BLACKNESS.]
CUT TO: EXT. THRONE ROOM, SPACE NIGHT
[Kneeling behind a THRONE, a clothed, armored figure known as THE OTHER.]
THE OTHER: The tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world. A human world. They would wield its power,... [he holds out the scepter]
Loki: [Coming out from the shadows, taking the staff]
THE OTHER: But our ally knows its workings as they never will. He is ready to lead. And our force, our Chitauri, will follow.
[thousands of Chitauri are awaiting orders]
THE OTHER: The world will be his. The universe yours. And the humans, what can they do but burn?
*****
[Cut to a SHIELD facility at night. They are evacuating by helicopter and vehicle, and one helicopter lands, dropping off Maria Hill and Nick Fury while Agent Phil Coulson is awaiting them.]
Nick Fury: How bad is it?
Agent Phil Coulson: That's the problem sir. We don't know.
[They enter the facility, passing fleeing technicians, taking only the essentials]
Agent Phil Coulson: Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.
Nick Fury: NASA didn't authorise Selvig to test phase.
Agent Phil Coulson: He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in the room. Spontaneous advancement.
Agent Maria Hill: It just turned itself on?
Nick Fury: What are the energy levels
Agent Phil Coulson: Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered evac.
Nick Fury: How long to get everyone out?
Agent Phil Coulson: Campus should be clear in the next half hour.
Nick Fury: Do better. 
[They continue walking down deeper into the facility]
Agent Maria Hill: Sir, evacuation may be futile.
Nick Fury: We should tell them to go back to sleep?
Agent Maria Hill: If we can't control the Tesseract's energy, there may not be a minimum safe distance.
Nick Fury: I need you to make sure Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.
Agent Maria Hill: Sir, is that really a priority right now?
Nick Fury: Until such a time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every peice of Phase 2 on a truck and gone.
Agent Maria Hill: Yes sir. [To agents nearby.] With me.
[Nick fury and Agent Phil Coulson enter the radiation facility housing the Tesseract, the area cluttered with machines and people leaving.]
Nick Fury: Talk to me doctor.
[Dr. Erik Selvig appears from behind a CMS machine, concerned. The Tesseract is glowing unusually birghter and a flare of blue shoots out from it, hitting things at random.]
Dr. Erik Selvig: Director.
Nick Fury: Is there anything we know for certain?
Dr. Erik Selvig: The Tesseract is misbehaving.
Nick Fury: Is that supposed to be funny?
Dr. Erik Selvig: No, it's not funny at all. The Tesseract is not only active, she's... misbehaving.
Nick Fury: How soon until you pull the plug?
Dr. Erik Selvig: She's an energy source. If we turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level...
Nick Fury: We've prepared for this doctor. Harnessing energy from space.
Dr. Erik Selvig: We don't have the harness. Our calculations are far from complete. Now she's throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.
Nick Fury: That can be harmful. Where's Barton?
Dr. Erik Selvig: The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual
[We cut to Clint Barton, dressed in black tactical gear, up on the railings watching them below. Fury calls Barton on his earpiece.]
Nick Fury: Agent Barton, report.
[Barton rappels down from the catwalk, and walks up to Fury. They both walk around the bottom of the facility in a discreet manner.]
Nick Fury: I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things.
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: Well, I see better from a distance.
Nick Fury: Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off?
NASA SCIENCETIST: [To Dr. Erik Selvig] Doctor, it's spiking again.
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: No one's come or gone. It's oven is clean. No contancts, no I.M.'s. If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end.
Nick Fury: At this end?
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides.
[Dr. Erik Selvig types on his keyboard and the monitor flashes. Suddenly, the Tesseract thunders and shakes the entire facility. Both Agent Coulson nearby, and Maria Hill topside, feel the tremors. The cube glows brighter and emits a ring of light, and builds like a beam, similar to the Bifrost bridge. The power hits the edge of the platform, and begins to form a vortex, which becomes a portal. Space appears through the portal, and a gust of blue energy knocks people back. The cloud shoots to the ceiling, and the portal on the platform opens up as Loki steps through. The portal vanishes, and Loki grins at everyone, holding his spear. He frowns as he sees them looking at him.]
Nick Fury: Sir please put down the spear.
[Loki responds with firing a blast of blue energy from his spear, while Barton narrowly tackles Fury out of the way. Everyone shoots at Loki, but the bullets deflect off of him. Loki immediately takes down everyone shooting at him easily, with knives and energy blasts from his sceptre. He pauses, grinning, and looks to who will attack him next. Barton attempts to attack him, but Loki grabs his wrist, disarming him.]
Loki: You have heart.
[Loki places the tip of the spear against Barton's chest. Barton's eye glow black, and he stops resisting. Loki begins controlling other agents around the room. Fury sneak up, grabs the Tesseract, and places it in a briefcase, trying to sneak out.]
Loki: Please don't. I still need that.
Nick Fury: [ turning to face Loki ] This doesn't have to get any messier.
Loki: Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Loki? Brother of Thor?
Nick Fury: We have no quarrel with your people.
Loki: An ant had no quarrel with a boot.
Nick Fury: You planning to step on us?
Loki: I come with glad tidings, of a world made free.
Nick Fury: Free from what?
Loki: Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart...[Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's standing behind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart. Selvig's eyes glow black.]
Loki: You will know peace.
Nick Fury: Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing.
[From the vacuum chamber ceiling, the Tesseract's energy cloud rapidly builds into what may be an implosion.]
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow. Drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us. 
Nick Fury: Like the Pharaohs of Odin.
Dr. Erik Selvig: He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself. You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.
Loki: Well then. 
[Loki looks to Barton, who without hesitation shoots Fury, who falls to the ground. Barton grabs the case containing the Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig, and the other controlled SHIELD personnel.]
*****
[The controlled SHEILD personnel are gathering weapons and getting ready to leave the facility. Agent Hill watches in confusion.]
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: [Pointing to Loki and his team] Need these vehicles.
Agent Maria Hill: Who's that?
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: He didn't tell me.
[Agent Hill eyes them suspiciously as they get into a truck and begin to drive away.]
Nick Fury: [grabbing a walkie talkie] Hill, do you copy?
[Loki and his crew look back at Agent Hill.]
[Back at the lab, Fury is sitting up, pulling the bullet out, and breathing hard.]
Nick Fury: Barton is...
[Maria turns around and shoots Barton, who is already shooting at her, and they drive away while she takes cover, still firing at them.]
Nick Fury: [Running out of the lab, holding his side.] He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
[The energy discharge from the Tesseract is building up on the ceiling, rumbling and growing recklessly, destroying structures and cracking the walls.]
[Maria Hill jumps into a Jeep and takes chase on Loki and crew. Several other trucks begin to attack Loki's truck as well, and Loki releases a blast of energy, obliterating SHEILD trucks and causing a blockage in the tunnel. Agent Hill is forced to keep distance on her pursuit.]
[Down below, Fury is racing against the clock as pipes burst around him. The walls are cracking, and the facility is suffering an internal earthquake.]
[Agent Coulson is grabbing cases, and trips down the stairs while the ground shudders. Others with him drop cases full of information and equipment.]
Agent Phil Coulson: No! Leave it!
[They all leave the cases behind and leave the lab running.]
[Barton and Agent Hill are caught in a truck race, where she pulls in front of him to try and block him. He responds with firing at her at close range, which causes Agent Hill to shoot out her own windshield to try and hit him.]
[Agent Coulson and his group take a Jeep and evacuate as well.]
Agent Phil Coulson: [on a walkie talkie] You're clear, sir! You need to go!
[Fury runs across the tarmac to a helicopter. The ground gives way seconds after the helicopter leaves the ground, falling into a sinkhole.]
[Still racing down the tunnel, Agent Hill and Barton are locked in combat. A blast wave from the Tesseract causes the tunnel to collapse partially. One of Loki's trucks makes it out, but Maria's truck is stuck.]
[The Tesseract's energy cloud now shrinks into a small ball of white light, hovering in the air. In a flash of blue light, the facility is consumed along with its surroundings. Fury watches from below as a rapid build up into an implosion.]
[Several miles away, Agent Coulson's van jolts from the blastwave on the horizon behind them.]
[The entire facility implodes with terrifying magnitude, and the implosion rocks the ground.]
[Maria Hill is stuck, her jeep behind as the full force of the blast tears down on the tunnel, covering herself by being inside of the jeep, light from the night spilling in close by.]
[Barton's truck drives away, but Fury's helicopter hovers over it, and Fury opens fire with his pistol. Loki, in a fit of rage, fires an energy blast at the helicopter. The helicopter is skimmed my the blast, but catches fire. He jumps out of the flaming helicopter seconds before it hits the ground and shreds itself into debris. Fury stands back up, dazed, and shoots at Loki, but they're too far away.]
Agent Phil Coulson: [over a walkie talkie] Director? Director Fury, do you copy?
Nick Fury: The tesseract is with the hostile force. I have men down. Hill?
Agent Maria Hill: [climbing out of the wreckage of her jeep] A lot of men still under, don't know how many survivors.
[From the ground, Fury surveys the wreckage.]
*****
Nick Fury: Sound the general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that briefcase.
Agent Maria Hill: [using a walkie talkie] Roger that.
Nick Fury: Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven. As of right now, we are at war.
Agent Phil Coulson: What do we do?
[Nick Fury looks up, a thought on his mind.]
*****
[The scene is is Russia. There is a building, a warehouse, next to some unfinished railroad tracks under construction. The building is only occupied by Georgi Luchkov, a Russian general, and two thugs, with a prisoner amongst them, tied to a chair. The taller thug is in the middle of hitting the spy, a red headed Russian woman in a black tank top. They have a conversation in Russian.]
General Luchkov: [in Russian] This is not how I wanted the evening to go.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: I know how you wanted this evening to go. Believe me, this is better.
General Luchkov: I'd like to know why they sent you to carry out a carrier, a stained glass and other random items.
[The taller thug pushes her chair back, tilting it over the edge of a few story drop, and Natasha hides her fear.]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: I thought General Solohob was in charge of the export business.
General Luchkov: Solohob? Your reputation is quite a progression. The famous Black Widow. Nothing but a pretty face.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: You really think I'm pretty?
[Luchkov walks over to a table filled with tools of torture and interrogation, picking up a pair of pliers. The tall thug next to her forces her jaw open.]
General Luchkov: We do not need the Lermontov to transfer the tanks. Tell him, well... [In english] You may have to write it down.
[A phone rings, and the weasely thug looks to his phone in confusion. He picks it up.]
Weasely Thug: Ya? [He looks to Luchkov.] It's for you. 
[Luchkov takes the phone, annoyed and angry.]
General Luchkov: Who the hell is...
Agent Phil Coulson: You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor. We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put the woman on the phone or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby.
[Luchkov places the cell phone against Natasha's ear seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her back.]
Agent Phil Coulson: We need you to come in.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Are you kidding? I'm working!
Agent Phil Coulson: This takes precedence.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: I'm in the middle of an interrogation and this moron is giving me everything.
General Luchkov: [Confused] I don't give everything. 
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: [Frowning at Luchkov] Look, you can't pull me out of this right now.
Agent Phil Coulson: Natasha. Barton's been compromised.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: [After a beat] Let me put you on hold.
[Natasha nods to Luchkov. When he grabs the phone, she hits him with her leg and headbuts him. She stands, still tied to the chair, and kickboxes the tall thug in the face. She rolls over to the weasely thug, trips him, and stomps on his foot when he tries to pin her, then she knocks him out with a headbut. Coulson waits calmly, listening to her take three men down with her arms literally tied behind her back. She flips, breaking the chair on weasely thugs' ribcage, and looks to the tall thug, standing up. She kicks him too, chocking him out cold. She then wraps Luchkov's legs with a chain and pushes him down the hole he was threatening to drop her down. He hangs there, in pain, and she grabs her shoes and the phone.]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Where's Barton now?
Agent Phil Coulson: We don't know.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: But he's alive.
Agent Phil Coulson: We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Coulson, you know that Stark only trusts me about as far as he can throw me. 
Agent Phil Coulson: No, I've got Stark. You get the big guy.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: [pausing and hanging up the phone.] Bozhe moi. [Russian translation for My God]
*****
[At night, a slum in India it attacked by a sickness. A little girl runs into the middle of a makeshift hospital in someone's home, pushing through the crowd frantically. She runs up the steps inside to greet the only doctor, Bruce Banner. They begin speaking in Hindu.]
ATTENDING WOMAN: What are you doing here?! Get out! You shouldn't be here. 
Little Girl: I have to see the doctor. It's my father.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Calm down. What's wrong?
Little Girl: My father... [she looks to the other sick people, laying down and moaning in pain.]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Is he like them?
[The little girl holds out money, crumpled and looking desperate.]
Little Girl: [In English] Please. 
[Banner and the little girl run quickly to the edge of town. She leads him quickly through narrow passageways, and is proving too fast to keep up with. Banner spots a nice car, and looks around, worried. He runs into the girls house, when she leaves through a window, untraceable.]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Should have gotten paid up front, Banner.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: [Entering the room behind him, making Banner turn around.] You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle. 
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Then, what is it? Yoga?
Bruce Banner / Hulk: You brought me to the edge of the city, smart. I uh... assume the whole place is surrounded?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Just you and me. 
Bruce Banner / Hulk: And your actress buddy, is she a spy too? Do they start that young?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: I did. 
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Who are you?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Natasha Romanoff.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff? Because that's not gonna work out for everyone.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: SHIELD. How did they find me?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: We never lost you, doctor. We've kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Why?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I need you to come in.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: What if I said no?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: I'll persuade you.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: And what if the... other guy says no?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: You've been more than a year without an incident. I don't think you wanna break that streak.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: [gently pushing a cradle] I don't always get what I want.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Well, those I actively try to avoid.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: This is the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.
[She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner takes a closer look.]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken. It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace. There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that's where I'd be.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: So Fury isn't after the monster?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Not that he's told me.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: And he tells you everything?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: He needs me in a cage?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: No one's gonna put you in a...
Bruce Banner / Hulk: STOP LYING TO ME! [Banner slams his fists onto the table]
[Natasha grabs a gun hidden under the table, pointing it at him. Banner stays still, grinning]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted to see what you'd do. Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that, and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay? Natasha...
[Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun and speaks into her earpiece.]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: [on her earpiece] Stand down. We're good here. 
[Dozens of soldiers armed to the teeth have surrounded the small house, but at her signal they back off a bit.]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: [smiles back at Natasha] Just you and me?
*****
[Inside a SHIELD analytical room, filled with monitors of partially silhouetted people. Fury stands in the middle, frowning. They make up the World Security Council.]
COUNCIL MEMBER 1: This is out of line, Director. You're dealing with forces you can't control.
Nick Fury: You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight? Did you feel an overabundance of control?
COUNCIL MEMBER 1: You saying that this Asgard has declared war on our planet?
Nick Fury: Not Asgard, Loki.
COUNCIL MEMBER 2: He can't be working alone. What about the other one? His brother.
Nick Fury: Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help. It's up to us.
COUNCIL MEMBER 1: Which is why you should be focusing on phase 2, it was designed for exactly...
Nick Fury: PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We need a response team.
COUNCIL MEMBER 1:  The Avengers Initiative was shut down.
Nick Fury:  This isn't about The Avengers.
COUNCIL MEMBER 1:  We're running the world's greatest covert security network and you're gonna leave the fate of human race to a handful of freaks.
Nick Fury:  I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need.
COUNCIL MEMBER 2: You believe?
COUNCIL MEMBER 1: War isn't won by sentiment, Director.
Nick Fury:  No, it's won by soldiers.

[A Brooklyn gym at night. Occupied by one man, beating a punching bag in the gym lights, alone in the floor, lost in the fight. The gym is old, as old as the man inside, Captain America, or Steve Rogers. He beats the bag harder, like physically hurting it will repress the memories.]
[FLASHBACK]
[Hydra base, Captain America is running through a forest, dodging mortar shells, gunfire and Tesseract energy blasts.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America:  [Echoey] There's not enough time! I gotta put her in the water!
[In the present, Steve's punches become harder and more violent.]
[in the flashback, Steve places the compass he has, featuring a picture of Peggy Carter, on the dash as the plane plummets towards the ice.]
[The present, punches become violent and aggressive.]
Peggy Carter: [flashback voice] You won't be alone. 
[Red Skull picked up the Tesseract, and vanishes.]
[In the present, Steve is breathing the bag with everything he has, destroying it and beating his fists.]
SHIELD SCIENCETIST: [flashback] Oh my god!
[Steve is lying on a table, half frozen, and still partially trapped in a slab of ice. Two SHIELD scientists run equipment over him, checking for his vitals. Something flickers...]
SHIELD SCIENCETIST: This guy is still alive!
[Present. Steve punched the bag, easily a hundred pounds, across the room with one swing snapping the metal chain and pummeling it back a dozen feet, sand spilling out from where he cracked the fabric. He stands up, breathing hard, and grabs another bag, resuming a more normal routine. Fury walks in.]
Nick Fury: Trouble sleeping?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I slept for seventy years, sir. I think I've had my fill.
Nick Fury: Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world.
[Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the tape off his hands. He sits down.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I went under, the world was at war, I wake up, they say we won. They didn't say what we lost.
Nick Fury: We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: You here with a mission, sir?
Nick Fury: I am. 
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Trying to get me back in the world?
Nick Fury:  Trying to save it. [Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files on HYDRA'S projects]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Hydra's secret weapon.
Nick Fury: Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Who took it from you?
Nick Fury: He's called Loki. He's not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.
Nick Fury: Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment.
[Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Fury starts walking out of the gym.] 
Nick Fury: Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: [Without missing a beat] You should have left it in the ocean.

[Out in the Atlantic Ocean, Tony Stark, in his Iron Man suit, is cutting a pipeline transport with a laser cutter coming from his hand. He then places a Stark Energy Reactor. It lights up. Iron Man rockets out of the water and flies towards Stark Tower]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You're good on this end. The rest is up to you.
Pepper Potts: [on the other line] You disconnected the transition lines? Are we off the grid?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.
Pepper Potts: Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over, and it actually works?
[INSIDE THE SUIT -- PEPPER APPEARS ON HIS HUD MONITOR.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I assume. Light her up. [Iron Man flies to the Stark Tower Building, the power is switched on the Stark sign lights up]
Pepper Potts: How does it look?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Like Christmas, but with more... me.
PEPPER Gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign. You need to do some press. I'm in DC tomorrow. I'm working on the zoning for the next three buildings.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Pepper, you're killing me. Remember the moment? Enjoy the moment.
Pepper Potts: Then get in here and I will. [Tony arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process of taking off his Iron Man suit through a hi-tech gauntlet of gadgets.]
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm not in. I'm actually out.
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.
[Pepper Potts stares up at the monitors of the reactor device.]
Pepper Potts: Levels are holding steady... I think.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which brings me to my next question: how does it feel to be a genius?
Pepper Potts: Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now, would I?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: What do you mean? All this came from you.
Pepper Potts: No. All this came from that. [Points to the energy in his chest plate.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself... twelve percent of the credit.
Pepper Potts: Twelve percent?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: An argument can be made for fifteen.
Pepper Potts: Twelve percent? For my baby?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you.
Pepper Potts: Oooooh.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: My private elevator...
Pepper Potts: You mean our elevator?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Was steaming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I?
[Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne.]
Pepper Potts: Not gonna be that subtle.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.
Pepper Potts: On the lease.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Call your mom, can you bunk over?
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my protocols are being overwritten.
Agent Phil Coulson: Stark, we need to talk.
[Tony picks up his phone and looks into it at Coulson.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message.
Agent Phil Coulson: This is urgent.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Then leave it urgently. [At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears.] Security breach. [To Pepper] That's on you.
Agent Phil Coulson: Mr. Stark
Pepper Potts: Phil! Come in.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.
Pepper Potts: Come on in, we're celebrating.
Agent Phil Coulson: I can't stay
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Which is why he can't stay.
Agent Phil Coulson: We need you to look this over. [He holds out a file towards Tony] Soon as possible.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I don't like being handed things.
Pepper Potts: That's alright, 'cause I love to be handed things. So, let's trade. [She pases her glass of champagne to Coulson, takes the file from him, then takes Tony's glass of champagne while passing the file over to Tony] Thank you.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.
Agent Phil Coulson: This isn't a consultation.
Pepper Potts: Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I know nothing about.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify.
Pepper Potts: I didn't know that either.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed, don't play well with others.
Pepper Potts: That I did know.
Agent Phil Coulson: This isn't about personality profiles anymore.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute? [Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own databases.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You know, I thought we were having a moment.
Pepper Potts: I was having twelve percent of a moment. This seems serious, Phil's pretty shaken.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: How did you notice? Why is he Phil?
Pepper Potts: What is all of this?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: This is, uh... [Tony expands his arms and different profiles appear in holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and Pepper.] This.
[Screens appear of Captain America in action, the Hulk roaring as he attacks the army at Culver University, and Thor fighting the Destroyer in New Mexico. Another is of Loki and the Tesseract to which Tony and Pepper look at in awe]
Pepper Potts: I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Tomorrow.
Pepper Potts: You've got homework. You've got a lot of homework.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Well, what if I didn't?
Pepper Potts: If you didn't?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah.
Pepper Potts: You mean if you finished? [Tony nods his head] Well, um...then. [She whispers something in his ear. Tony gasps. Coulson looks away in embarrassment.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Square deal. It's the last date.
[Pepper kisses him.]
Pepper Potts: Work hard.
[As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in holograph form, worried.]
*****
[Inside the Quinjet, Steve is sitting down with a tablet, watching the footage of the Hulk's attack on the Army at Culver University]
Pilot: We're about forty minutes out from base, sir.
[Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?
Agent Phil Coulson: A lot of people were. You were the world's first superhero. Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula. [The Hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Didn't really go his way, did it?
Agent Phil Coulson: Not so much. When he's not that thing though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking. [Steve looks confused.] He's like a smart person. I gotta say, it's an honor to meet you, officially. [Steve smiles at Coulson.] I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. [Steve looks down. He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to the side with Coulson following.] I mean, I was... I was present while you were unconscious from the ice. You know, it's really, it's just a... just a huge honor to have you on board.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.
Agent Phil Coulson: Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little... old fashioned?
Agent Phil Coulson: With everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned. [Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment.]

[in the underground lab, Several soldiers under Loki's mind control run around, preparing to infiltrate whatever Loki has planned. Loki sits down, watching Selvig work with a CMS device. Loki meditates, until...the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of the Other, fully armed in his horned helmet and armor. The other appears from the steps.]
THE OTHER: The Chitauri grow restless
Loki: Let them go at themselves. I will lead them into glorious battle.
THE OTHER: Battle? Against the meager might of Earth?
Loki: Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim.
THE OTHER: You question us? You question him? He who put the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out, defeated?
Loki: I was a king! The rightful kind of Asgard! Betrayed!
THE OTHER: Your ambition is little, born of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.
Loki: You don't have the Tesseract yet. [The Other runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his scepter.] I don't threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words.
THE OTHER: You will have your war, Asgardian. If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice where he can't find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something as sweet as pain. [The Other places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back to Earth. Loki looks around, cautiously.]
*****
[The Quinjet lands down a massive battleship known as the Helicarrier. It has two runways. One with direct access to a hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel. Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with Natasha.]
Agent Phil Coulson: Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Ma'am?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Hi. [She looks at Coulson] They need you on the bridge. They're starting the face-trace.
Agent Phil Coulson: See you there. [Coulson walks away, leaving Steve with Natasha, the pair walking towards the railing of the Helicarrier]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Trading cards?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: They're vintage, he's very proud.
[Bruce Banner is seen walking around the ship, trying to stay out of the way while people walk in his way]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Dr. Banner.
[The two walk up to each other and shake hands]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be coming.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Word is you can find the cube.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Is that the only word on me?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Only word I care about.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: [Takes in the sentiment] It must be strange for you, all of this.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: [Looks off to where a group of men in training are running, remembering his days in the army] Well, this is actually kind of familiar.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute. It's gonna get a little hard to breath.
[The Helicarrier starts to shake as it prepares to take "sail". Others abord strap down planes and Quinjets in preparation]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Is this a submarine?
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Really? They wanted me in a submerged, pressurized metal container?
[The two both move closer to the edge of the Helicarrier. Four huge lift fans mounted on the sides starts to lift into the air as the ship takes flight. Steve watches in awe while Bruce just smiles.]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Oh, no. This is much worse.
[The doors part and we enter the bridge of the ship. A flurry of activity, dozens of agents sit in front of their viewscreens. Agent Hill shouts instructions to leave. The camera turns to Nick Fury who is at the command chair.]
Agent Maria Hill: We're at lock, sir.
Nick Fury: Good. Let's vanish.
[The Helicarrier rises high into the heavens. Suddenly the entire ship is covered in reflecting mirrors, which then camouflages in the sky. Steve and Banner walk through the glorious, gleaming bridge]
Nick Fury: Gentlemen. [Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it.] Doctor, thank you for coming.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how long am I staying?
Nick Fury: Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Where are you with that? [Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen.]
Agent Phil Coulson: We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet. Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: That's still not gonna find them in time.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: You have to narrow the field. How many spectrometers do you have access to?
Nick Fury: How many are there?
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work?
Nick Fury: Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please. [Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall.]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.
*****
[Back in the underground lab, Selvig and several scientists work around the CMS device. Clint walks in, holding a tablet.]
Dr. Erik Selvig: Put it over there! [To Clint] Where did you find all these people?
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: SHIELD has not shortage of enemies, Doctor. [He holds up a screen showing information on Iridium]. Is this the stuff you need?
Dr. Erik Selvig: Yeah, iridium. It's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's very hard to get hold of.
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Well, I didn't know! [Sees Loki coming] Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so much. It's more than just knowledge, it's... truth.
Loki: I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton?
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: My next target.
Loki: Tell me what you need.
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: I'll need a distraction. [Grabs his bow] And an eyeball.
*****
[That night in the Helicarrier bridge. As they are waiting to locate Loki using satellite facial recognition, Coulson is standing with Steve.]
Agent Phil Coulson: I mean, if it's not too much trouble.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: No, no. It's fine.
Agent Phil Coulson: It's a vintage set. It took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint, slight foxing around the edges, but...
AGENT JASPER SITWELL: We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent match. Weight, cross match, seventy-nine percent.
Agent Phil Coulson: Location?
Sitwell: Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse. He's not exactly hiding.
Nick Fury: Captain, you're up. [Steve nods. Leaves.]
*****
[Outside the Stuttgart Museum, night. Loki is standing in front of the museum, dressed in 21st Century attire with his scepter disguised as a cane. He walks up to the entrance of the gala.]
[Inside the Stuttgart Museum. A lavished gala with an orchestra playing is interrupted as the head doctor walks up to the mic.]
[Inside Helicarrier where Steve's locker is. Steve walks into the locker room. As he approaches to the steel cabinet, the doors already reveal the updated Captain America uniform, along with the famous shield. He stands in silence]
[Outside the museum. German guards stand in their positions. One of them is standing on tip of the roof, scoping. He then hears a sound. He looks down. One of his guards is shot with an arrow. He raises his gun. He is shot dead by an arrow. Falls down. Barton and his crew arrive at the doors of the locked science building. Barton looks at the retinal scanner. He pulls out a SHIELD eye scanner instrument.]
[Inside the gala, Loki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the head doctor is. As he makes it down and near the stage, he flips his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out his gun, but Loki clubs his head in. Chaos erupts. Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures bilchsteim. Loki pulls out an optical torture device. He plunges down the doctor's eye. The doctor twists in pain.]
[Outside the museum. Suddenly from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on screen. The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium. As the crowd runs away, Loki slowly walks out and materializes in his gold armor and helmet. The police arrive and with no hesitation, he blasts the cars, flipping them over and over.]
Loki: Kneel before me. [The crowd ignores him. Three more Loki's appear, surrounding and blocking the crowd from escaping.] I said KNEEL! [While the crowd quietly kneels, Loki embraces out his arms with a wide smile] Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel.
Elder German Man: [As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an elder German man refuses to kneel and stands, heroic.] Not to men like you.
Loki: There are no men like me.
Elder German Man: There are always men like you.
Loki: Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example. [As Loki is about to execute the man with his scepter as the light glows blue. Right as the energy beam shoots out, Captain America arrives, diving in just in time to block the blast with his shield, and knocking down Loki]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing.
Loki: [Standing up] The soldier. A man out of time.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I'm not the one who's out of time.
[From above Captain America, the Quinjet arrives. A machine gun is pointed towards Loki, while Natasha speaks from inside the aircraft]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.
[Like greased lightning, Loki sends a blast of blue at the Quinjet. Natasha maneuvers it just in time, giving Cap the time to throw his shield at Loki. They both began to duke it out. Loki flings Cap to the ground, and then Cap throws his shield, but Loki swats it away. As Cap is knocked down by Loki, the scepter is pointed to Cap's helmet]
Loki: Kneel.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Not today! [Cap flips and knocks him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and flips him over]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: This guy's all over the place.
[Suddenly AC/DC's "Shoot to Thrill" overdrives to the Quinjets speakers]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Agent Romanoff, did you miss me? [Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his Iron Man suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. Iron Man touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry the suit has.] Make your move, Reindeer Games.
[Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armour materializes away]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Good move.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Mr. Stark.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Captain.
*****
INT. QUINJET ­ NIGHT
[Natasha watches the skies. THUNDER. Coming out of nowhere. Fury speaks over her headset.]
NICK FURY: Said anything?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Not a word.
NICK FURY: Just get him here. We're low on time.
[With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch from a distance, whispering.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I don't like it.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: What?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, during your time as a Capsicle.
[Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.
[THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake violently.]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Where's this coming from?
[Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?
Loki: I'm not overly fond of what follows.
[OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet. Not a light. A King. THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony puts the IRON MAN helmet on.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Now there's that guy.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Another Asgardian?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Think the guy's a friendly?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost. Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after Thor.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Stark, we need a plan of attack!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I have a plan. Attack.
[IRON MAN jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor. Cap grabs a parachute to follow.]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: I'd sit this one out, Cap.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I don't see how I can.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: These guys come from legends, they're basically gods.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
[Cap JUMPS OUT of the jet.]
*****
EXT. MOUNTAIN LEDGE ­ NIGHT
[Somewhere out in the European mountains, Thor throws Loki into the side of the mountain. He raises the mighty hammer, MJÖLNIR. He looks down at his brother, who he thought to be dead and is angry to see him alive in this fashion.]
Thor: Where is the Tesseract?
Loki: (LAUGHS) I missed you too.
Thor: Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!
Loki: Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth.
[Thor drops MJÖLNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up Loki. His brother. Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is everything to a man or god.]
Thor: I thought you died.
Loki: Did you mourn?
Thor: We all did. Our father...
Loki: Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not? Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even bigger wedge between them.
Thor: We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that?
Loki: (TURNS AROUND) I remember a shadow. Living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I was and should be king!
Thor: So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights. No, the Earth is under my protection, Loki.
Loki: (LAUGHS) And you're doing a marvelous job with that. The humans slaughter each other in droves, while you idly threat. I mean to rule them. And why should I not?
Thor: You think yourself above them.
Loki: Well, yes.
Thor: Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill.
[Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up to the ledge. Turns around.]
Loki: I've seen worlds you've never known about! I have grown, Odinson, in my exile! I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it...
Thor: Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king?
Loki: I am a king!
Thor: Not here! You give up the Tesseract! You give up this poisonous dream! You come home.
Loki: I don't have it. You need the cube to bring me home, but I've sent it off. I know not where.
[Mjölnir flies back to his grasp.]
Thor: You listen well, brother. I...
[Thor is knocked off the mountain by Iron Man who tackles him in mid-flight.]
Loki: I'm listening.
EXT. FOREST ­ CONTINUOUS
[THOR and IRON MAN CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up. IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet opens up.]
Thor: Do not touch me again!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Then don't take my stuff.
Thor: You have no idea what you're dealing with.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?
Thor: This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then, stay out of my way... tourist.
The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjölnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear across into a tree.
[INSIDE THE SUIT]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Okay.
[From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises his hand. Mjölnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the hammer, summoning a ray of energy. IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and knocks Thor into a tree.] Right back at you, bitch! [Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mjölnir to his hand, raises it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back.]
[INSIDE THE SUIT]
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Power at 400% capacity.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: How about that?
[IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up.]
EXT. SKY ­ NIGHT
[The two battle. IRON MAN grasps THOR, elbowing him and SMASHING him into the side of a mountain. THOR LEAPS off the mountain and takes IRON MAN with him.]
EXT. FOREST ­ CONTINUOUS
[THOR and IRON MAN crash right back down, smashing down every tree possible. IRON MAN YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face. Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor, with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with his fuckin' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest. IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up, ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift him and SMASH him down hard. Thor summons back Mjölnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him, but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce... CAPTAIN AMERICA'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN, stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Hey! That's enough! (comes down; looks at Thor) Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.
Thor: I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes!
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Then prove it! Put the hammer down.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his hammer!
[THOR BACKHANDS IRON MAN LIKE A PIMP WITH MJÖLNIR. Thor, losing all tolerance with this SENTENTIAL OF LIBERTY, raises the hammer.]
Thor: [to Cap] You want me to put the hammer down?
[THOR LEAPS HIGH INTO THE AIR, RAISING THAT FUCKING HAMMER. CAPTAIN AMERICA CROUCHES DOWN and HOLDS UP HIS SHIELD. THOR brings that hammer down onto the shield and a MASSIVE IMPLOSION OF LIGHT reacts to the vibranium shield creating a MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE THAT BLOWS UP ANYTHING STANDING WITHIN A MILE. IRON MAN stands up, looking around like `holy shit.' Lying right next to him is Cap, who never takes his eye off Thor. Thor looks at both men.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Are we done here?
[THOR, CAPTAIN AMERICA AND IRON MAN STAND THERE.]
*****
INT. HELICARRIER HALLWAY ­ NIGHT
[DOZENS of SHIELD POLICE escort Loki, who is in handcuffs, smiling. As they pass the HELICARRIER LAB, Banner stops working on the CHITAURI SCEPTER and looks up. Loki eyes him as he walks, nodding and smiling. BANNER rubs his head.]
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ NIGHT
[Loki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a LARGE GLASS CELL held by HYDRAULIC RIGS. Fury walks up the control panel of the cell.]
Nick Fury:  In case it's unclear. You try to escape. You so much as scratch that glass.
[Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass. Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit his pants. Not a god, though.]
Nick Fury: Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works?!
[Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki.]
Nick Fury: Ant.
[Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel trap.]
Nick Fury: Boot.
Loki: (SMIRKING) It's an impressive cage. Not built, I think, for me.
Nick Fury: Built for something a lot stronger than you.
Loki: Oh, I've heard.
[Loki looks into the camera.]
INT. BRIEFING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS
[The others watch on the monitor Loki getting interrogated. Banner looks at the monitor, intently.]
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ CONTINUOUS
Loki: The mindless beast, makes play he's still a man. How desperate are you, that you call upon such lost creatures to defend you?
Nick Fury: How desperate am I? You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control. You talk about peace and you kill `cause it's fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did.
Loki: Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power. And for what? A warm light for all mankind to share, and then to be reminded what real power is.
Nick Fury: (SMILING) Well, you let me know if Real Power wants a magazine or something.
[Fury walks off leaving Loki in his glass cell. Loki looks back at the camera, smirking.]
*****
INT. BRIEFING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS
[Steve watches until the monitor goes black. Thor, who didn't even look, just listened, stands there, torn apart. They all just stand there in stunned SILENCE. Finally...]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: He really grows on you, doesn't he?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what's his play?
Thor: (COMING TOO) He has an army called the Chitauri. They're not of Asgard or any world known. He means to lead them against your people. They will win him the earth. In return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: (SERIOUSLY) An army? From outer space?
Bruce Banner / Hulk: So he's building another portal. That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.
Thor: Selvig?
Bruce Banner / Hulk: He's an astrophysicist.
Thor: He's a friend.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Loki has him under some kind of spell, along with one of ours.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I wanna know why Loki let us take him. He's not leading an army from here.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: I don't think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him.
Thor: Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's my brother.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: He killed eighty people in two days.
Thor: He's adopted.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: I think it's about the mechanics. Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: It's a stabilizing agent. (walks in with Coulson; to COULSON) I'll fly you there. Keep the love alive. Means the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD.
TONY (CONT'D) (TO THOR): No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing. (referring to the Iridium) Also, it means the portal can open as wide, and stay open as long, as Loki wants. (TO CREW) Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top sails. That man is playing GALAGA! Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did. (covering his eye, looks AROUND) How does Fury do this?
Agent Maria Hill: He turns.
[Tony looks around the monitors and places a BUTTON SIZE HACKING IMPLANT under Fury's desk, without anyone noticing.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube.
Agent Maria Hill: When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?
Bruce Banner / Hulk: He's got to heat the cube to a hundred and twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Well, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Finally, someone who speaks English.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Is that what just happened?
[Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as the mutual respect for each other shows.]
TONY : It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner. Your work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: (LOOKS DOWN) Thanks.
Nick Fury: (WALKING IN) Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube. I was hoping you might join him.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Let's start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.
Nick Fury: I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube. And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.
Thor: Monkeys? I do not understand.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I do! I understood that reference.
[Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Shall we play, doctor?
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Let's play some.
[As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to playing.]
*****
INT. BANNER'S LAB - NIGHT (LATER)
[Banner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on the scepter for radiation. Tony looks at his monitors, shifting and solving as many algorithms and equations.]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to process.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: All I packed was a tooth brush.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: (SMILES) You know, you should come by STARK TOWER sometime. Top ten floors, all R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises.
[Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD. Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony.]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: OW!
[Tony looks at Banner closely.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Hey!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Nothing?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Are you nuts?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Is everything a joke to you?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Funny things are.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny. No offense, Doctor.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy things.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: You think Fury's hiding something?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets. (points to Banner) It's bugging him too, isn't it?
Bruce Banner / Hulk: (bobbling the words) Uh...I just wanna finish my work here and...
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Doctor?
[A beat.]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: 'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I heard it.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: (pointing at Tony) Well, I think that was meant for you. Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Stark Tower? That big ugly (Tony gives him a look) ...building in New York?
Bruce Banner / Hulk: It's powered by Stark Reactors, self-sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for what, a year?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: That's just the prototype. I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: (referring to Tony) So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? I mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: (taken aback by that) I'm sorry, did you say...?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. (holds out a bag of blueberries) Blueberry?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not possible.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I think Loki's trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war, and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Following is not really my style.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: (SMILING) And you're all about style, aren't you?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: (a nerve hit) Of the people in this room, which one is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use?
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you?
[Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier, shakes it off.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Just find the cube.
[Steve walks out of the lab. Still torn apart by the possibility, he walks away, towards the HULL of the ship.]
BACK IN THE LAB
Tony Stark / Iron Man: That's the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does have the jump on us.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit. It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: And I'll read all about it.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor. I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a nightmare.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. (points at the MINI-ARC REACTOR in his chest) This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: But you can control it.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Because I learned how.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: It's different.
[Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gamma exposure should have killed you.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: So you're saying that the Hulk... the other guy... saved my life? That's nice. It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: (A BEAT) I guess we'll find out.
[Banner and Stark get back to work at their respective computers.]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: You might not like that.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You just might.

INT. HULL HANGAR, SECURE STORAGE 10-C ­ NIGHT
[Steve, with all his MIGHT, slides the HEAVY IRON door and STEALTHILY walks in. SECURE STORAGE 10-C is a large warehouse, filled with METAL CRATES stacked. Steve looks up, seeing another level. He LEAPS up high and holds onto the catwalk railing. Steve continues to move forward.]

INT. VAN ­ NIGHT
[Inside this particular van, Selvig and a few other SOLDIERS are driving inside a long tunnel. With the CMS device inside, Selvig carefully picks up the small cylinder shape IRIDIUM with metal prongs and lightly places it in a SLOT within the CMS. THE CMS ACCEPTS IT. Selvig looks at it, devilishly smiling.]
*****
INT. BRIEFING ROOM ­ NIGHT
[On a SHIELD monitor is a photo and record of JANE FOSTER. Thor looks at her, remembering. With him is Agent Coulson.]
Agent Phil Coulson: As soon as Loki took the doctor we moved Jane Foster. We've got an excellent observatory in Tromso. She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee, private plane, very remote. She'll be safe.
Thor: Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig; I dread what he plans for him once he's done. Erik is a good man.
Agent Phil Coulson: He talks about you a lot. You changed his life. You changed everything around here.
Thor: They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we... we come here battling like BILCHSNIPE.
Agent Phil Coulson: Like what?
Thor: BILCHSNIPE? You know; huge, scaly, big antlers. You don't have those?
Agent Phil Coulson: Don't think so.
Thor: They are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path.
[Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the window, lamenting about what had happened and what may come.]
Thor: When I first came to Earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war.
Nick Fury: War hasn't started yet. (WALKING IN) You think you can make Loki tell us what the Tesseract is?
Thor: I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield, it's not just power he craves, it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain that would prize his need from him.
Nick Fury: A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops.
Thor: What are you asking me to do?
Nick Fury: I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?
Thor: Loki is a prisoner.
Nick Fury: Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here?
[Thor doesn't answer.]
*****
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ NIGHT
[Loki walks back and forth inside his glass cell. Suddenly, he stops.]
Loki: There's not many people that can sneak up on me. (turns to see NATASHA STANDING THERE)
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: But you figured I'd come.
Loki: After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: I wanna know what you've done to Agent Barton.
Loki: I'd say I've expanded his mind.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: And once you've won. Once you're king of the mountain. What happens to his mind?
Loki: Is this love, Agent Romanoff?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Love is for children. I owe him a debt.
Loki: (SITTING DOWN) Tell me.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: (she pulls up a chair as WELL) Before I worked for SHIELD, I uh...well, I made a name for myself. I have a very specific skillset. I didn't care who I used it for, or on. I got on SHIELD's radar in a bad way. Agent Barton was sent to kill me, he made a different call.
Loki: And what will you do if I vow to spare him?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Not let you out.
Loki: (LAUGHS) Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Regimes fall every day. I tend not to weep over that, I'm Russian... or was.
Loki: What is it you want?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: It's really not that complicated. I've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.
Loki: Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? DRAKOV'S daughter? SÃO PAULO? THE HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it's gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything? (STANDING; ANGRY) This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child at prayer... PATHETIC!
INTERCUTS - Tony and Banner continuously work at their monitors.
LOKI (V.O.): You lie and kill in the service of liars and killers.
[Agent Hill checks every VIEWSCREEN in the bridge. Fury oversees.]
LOKI (V.O.) You pretend to be separate, to have your own code, something that makes up for the horrors. But they are a part of you, and they will never go away!
[Steve opens a STEEL crate. Angry, he looks behind him and looks back into the crate. THE CRATE IS FILLED WITH AN ARRAY OF HYDRA WEAPONS.]
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ NIGHT
[Loki SLAMS his cell, making Natasha FLINCH.]
Loki: I won't touch Barton. Not until I make him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In every way he knows you fear! And when he'll wake just long enough to see his good work, and when he screams, I'll split his skull! This is my bargain, you mewling quim!
[NATASHA turns around, walks away from Loki, disgusted.]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: (QUIETLY; DISTRAUGHT) You're a monster.
Loki: (LAUGHS) No, you brought the monster.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: (turns back around; poised) So, Banner... that's your play.
Loki: (STAGGERED) What?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: (ON EARPIECE) Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send Thor as well. (TO LOKI) Thank you for your cooperation.
[Natasha quickly walks out, leaving Loki frozen.]
*****
INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING
[Fury walks in SURPRISED to see Tony and Banner stop working on the scepter.]
Nick Fury: (ANGRY) What are you doing, Mr. Stark?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you.
Nick Fury: You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: We are. The model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. (suddenly his monitor show a collection of SECRET FILES) What is PHASE 2?
[Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make weapons. (TO TONY) Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow.
Nick Fury: (trying to explain) Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we're...
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm sorry, Nick.
[Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of THE WEAPONS.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: What were you lying?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I was wrong, director. The world hasn't changed a bit.
[At that moment, Thor and Natasha walk into the lab. Natasha keeps her eyes right on Banner. Banner looks at her, PISSED.]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Did you know about this?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor?
Bruce Banner / Hulk: I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Loki's manipulating you.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: And you've been doing what exactly?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.
Nick Fury: Because of him. (pointing at Thor)
Thor: (STUNNED) Me?
Nick Fury: Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.
Thor: My people want nothing but peace with your planet.
Nick Fury: But you're not the only people out there, are you? And, you're not the only threat. The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, they can't be controlled.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Like you controlled the cube?
Thor: Your work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for a higher form of war.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: A higher form?
Nick Fury: You forced our hand. We had to come up with something.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always calms everything right down.
Nick Fury: Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck deep...
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Wait! Wait! Hold on! How is this now about me?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I'm sorry, isn't everything?
Thor: I thought humans were more evolved than this.
Nick Fury: Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet and blow stuff up?
Thor: Did you always give your champions such mistrust?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Are you all really that naive? S.H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threats.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Captain America is on the threat potential watch list?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: (to Steve) You're on that list? Are you above or below angry bees?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I swear to God, Stark, one more crack...
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Threatening! I feel threatened!
[As the "team" argues, they don't realize the BLUE GEM on Loki's scepter is glowing brightly.]

INT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER ­ DAY
Outside the HELICARRIER, a lone carrier slowly hovers over the ship.
SHIELD BASE VOICE: 661 Bravo, please relay your pass code. What is your hull, over?
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: Arms to ammunition, over.
[Inside, BARTON and his crew suit up and arm themselves. Barton pulls out his hi-tech bow and arrows.]
*****
INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING
[Back in the lab, the egos of these people keep rubbing off each other and at any moment, the shit will hit the fan.]
Thor: You speak of control, yet you court chaos.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We're... we're a time-bomb.
Nick Fury: You need to step away.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: (puts his arm around Steve) Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: (pushes Tony off)You know damn well why! Back off!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: (comes face-to-face with Cap) Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I think I would just cut the wire.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: (SMILING) Always a way out... You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: (that did it) A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle!

OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
[The ramp of the carrier opens. The carrier maneuvers next to one of the large turbine engines. Barton stands at the base, holding out his bow. He pulls out a GRENADE TIPPED ARROW. He points right at the engine. Then...Barton moves his AIM and points the arrow about a hundred feet from the engine. He releases. The arrow flies out,but then SHARPLY heads for the engine. The arrow is punctured onto the engine. It has a visible timer which is COUNTING DOWN.]
*****
INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING
[Back in the lab, Steve puffs up his chest at Tony, who just stands there, unmoving.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds.
[Thor laughs at them.]
Thor: You people are so petty... and tiny.
[Tony rubs his head. Moves away from Cap.]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Yeah, this is a team…
Nick Fury: Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr.Banner back to his…
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Where? You rented my room.
Nick Fury: The cell was just in case…
Bruce Banner / Hulk: In case you needed to kill me, but you can't! I know! I tried! (A BEAT) I got low. I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out! So I moved on. I focused on helping other people. I was good, until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk!
[Banner slowly gets upset as he looks at Romanoff, who gets ]unnerved.]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm?
[BLACK WIDOW and Fury have their hands down to grab their guns.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Doctor Banner... put down the scepter.
[BANNER LOOKS DOWN AND IS SHOCKED TO SEE HE'S HOLDING LOKI'S SCEPTER. The computer beeps. They all turn to it.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Got it.
[Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer.]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my little party trick after all.
Thor: Located the Tesseract?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I can get there faster.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Look, all of us…
Thor: The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no human is a match for it.
[Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: You're not going alone!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You gonna stop me?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Put on the suit, let's find out.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm not afraid to hit an old man.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Put on the suit.

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY
[PANDEMONIUM ERUPTS. Emergency alarms set off, fire extinguishers activate near surrounding fires and every agent is in a spinning scramble for their positions and armaments. Agent Hill keeps the bridge as calm as possible.]
Agent Maria Hill: Turn up that engine! Number 3 engine is: down! Can we get a run in? (runs over to GALAGA PLAYER) Talk to me.
GALAGA PLAYER: (points to monitor) Turbine's loose. Mostly intact, but it's impossible to get out there and make repairs while we're in the air.
Agent Maria Hill: We lose one more engine, we won't be. Somebody's got to get inside and patch that engine.

[FOCUS ON BANNER'S FACE in the dim light as he struggles to suppress the rage, but his face is growing, changing slowly. Natasha is pulling herself painfully free, talking to Banner.]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it. This is just what Loki wants. We're gonna be okay. Listen to me.
[Two approaching SHIELD soldiers arrive to check on her. She furiously WAVES them away. They bolt out of there.]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: We're gonna be okay. Right? I swear on my life I will get you out of this, you will walk away, and never…
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Your life?
[His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is morphing to a growled threat. Another explosion rocks the carrier -- and he turns to look at her, transforming just as the lights go out.]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: (PLEADING) Bruce.
[Banner suddenly starts transforming into the HULK and gives Natasha one last knowing look. Natasha STRUGGLES FREE of the rubble. She stops. The HULK, sensing her, turns his head and puts on a face of a disturbing monster. Natasha JOLTS up the stairs with the HULK chasing after her. Natasha maneuvers like a black widow should. She rolls under a turbine, starts to crawl within the maze of pipes. The HULK pulls them out from above the catwalk. Natasha falls through under the catwalks and quickly and stealthily escapes. The HULK lets out a ROAR OF RAGE unlike anything. PRIMAL. Not human.]

Nick Fury: Bring the carrier inwards and head south. Take us to the water.
Helmsman: Why water? Navigations recalibrated after the engine failure.
Nick Fury: Is the sun coming up?!
Helmsman: Yes, sir.
Nick Fury: Then put it on the left! Get us over water! One more turbine goes down and we drop.

Tony Stark / Iron Man: I need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position.
[IRON MAN flies into giant cooling conductors. CAPTAIN AMERICA JUMPS over to the other side of the broken railing. CAPTAIN AMERICA gets himself to the control panel and opens it up. For a man who grew up as a YANK, what the fuck is this!]

Natasha pulls out her gun and slowly walks out onto the catwalk and spins. ...and then a ROAR. THE HULK. Natasha FIRES a shot into a liquid nitrogen pipe that hits the hulk in face. The HULK SMASHES THE SHIT OUT OF IT. Natasha begins to run through the maze of corridors. The sound the monster is coming. Finally, she reaches and a long corridor. As she runs, behind her, the HULK TEARS up the hallway, coming at her. Natasha turns to see, but the HULK SLAPS her into the wall, SMASHING INTO THE GROUND. The HULK marks his territory. Natasha looks up. A fear she has never felt begins to seep out. The HULK raises his hand and IS KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET BY THOR WHO TACKLES HIM INTO the next room.]

[Both Thor and HULK roll across the floor. Every person runs the hell out. Thor looks up at this magnificent beast. The HULK stands up and moving like a boxer, wants Thor to make his move. The HULK makes his move. SWING AND A MISS. Thor swings his massive hand and almost knocks HULK off his feet. HULK keeps swinging and missing, pissing him off. Finally, he brings down his arm, but Thor grabs it and wraps around it.]
Thor: We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to think!

Tony Stark / Iron Man: Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. I'm gonna have to get in there and push.
EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Well if that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag…

ESCORT 606 PILOT: TARGET ANGRY! TARGET ANGRY!

Fury FIRES at Barton, but is already gone. The arrow then self- activates and inserts itself into the outlets, hacking every single monitor and main frame. The hacking causes Engine 1 to shut off. Suddenly, the HELICARRIER begins to DANGEROUSLY TILT to one side.]

Nick Fury: It's Barton. He took out our systems. He's headed for the detention level. Does anybody copy?
*****
INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER- DAY
[Still shaken by the HULK ordeal, Natasha sits there, rocking back and forth, after crying for a while. Summoning back all her coolness, she touches her EARPIECE.]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: This is Agent Romanoff. I copy.
[Natasha SPRINGS up and runs for Barton.]
*****
EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY
[IRON MAN begins to push the rotor using BOOSTERS from his boots.]
NICK FURY (V.O.): Stark, we're losing altitude.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah. Noticed.
[The rotors start propelling faster and faster as IRON MAN'S BOOSTERS get more and more bright. On the other side, CAPTAIN AMERICA continuously shoots at Barton's men. Blinking at the wrong moment, CAPTAIN AMERICA loses the upper hand and SLIDES off the railing, but grabs onto a LOOSE CABLE.]
*****
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY
[Thor runs into the detention section where he finds Loki, escaping.]
Thor: NO!
[Thor CHARGES at his brother. Loki walks up to him and CROUCHES down to attack. THOR ONLY GOES THROUGH HIM. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness. THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind the cell door, which closes on THOR, locking him up. Loki smiles.]
Loki: Are you ever not going to fall for that?
*****
INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ DAY
[Barton walks alone down the catwalk. In a lightning fast move, Barton nocks an arrow, and points it at NATASHA. A hand-to-hand fight ensues. Natasha CRAWLS her way around Barton, making Barton to drop his bow, but pulls out a KNIFE on her.]
*****
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY
[Thor, in a fit of anger, SLAMS MJÖLNIR onto the glass cell. To his surprise, the cell door only CRACKS, but violently SHAKES the ship. Loki stands there in caution, as does his GUARDING SOLDIER.]
Loki: (smiles; walks over to the CONTROL PANEL) The humans think us immortal. Should we test that?
[Suddenly, GUARDING SOLDIER falls down like a tree. AGENT COULSON stands there, holding PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE.]
Agent Phil Coulson: Move away, please.
[Loki moves away from the switch.]
Agent Phil Coulson: You like this? We started working on the prototype after you sent THE DESTROYER. Even I don't know what it does. Do you wanna find out?
[A LOUD GASP. AGENT COULSON IS IMPALED THROUGH THE HEART. THE REAL LOKI STANDS BEHIND COULSON.]
Thor: Nooo!
[Loki sends Agent Coulson against the wall. Agent Coulson slumps down, breathing fast. Loki makes his way to the control switch. He gives his brother one last look. Thor looks at him, hopeful. Loki opens the HATCH. Thor still hopes. LOKI HITS THE BUTTON AND DROPS THOR OUT OF THE SHIP.]
*****
INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ DAY
[Barton and Natasha continue attacking each other. Natasha KICKBOXES Barton's face. Feeling that, Barton takes a SWING at her, but she grabs his arm, TWISTING it. BARTON WRITHES IN PAIN. Using his other arm, he tosses the knife over and begins to SLASH at Natasha. She dodges every move, but finds herself in a LOCK HOLD with him. As he forces the knife down, she BITES his wrist. Barton lets go of the knife. Natasha WRAPS her legs around his neck, FLIPS him over and arm LOCKS him. She SLAMS his head into a pipes rail. Barton goes down, hard. He looks up her, almost coming to his real senses.]
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: Natasha…
[Natasha COLDCOCKS him. Barton is out.]
*****
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY
[Loki has no remorse as he looks down. He closes the hatch and proceeds to leave. A WEAK VOICE.]
Agent Phil Coulson: You're gonna lose.
Loki: (TURNING) Am I?
Agent Phil Coulson: It's in your nature.
Loki: Your heroes are scattered, your floating fortress falls from the sky...where is my disadvantage?
Agent Phil Coulson: You lack conviction.
Loki: I don't think I…
[AGENT COULSON SHOOTS LOKI WITH HIS PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE, CAUSING LOKI TO BE BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL BEHIND HIM.]
Agent Phil Coulson: So that's what it does.
*****
INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY
[Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN that the hatch has been open. Knowing Agent Coulson was sent there, he goes to.]
*****
EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY
[IRON MAN continuously SPINS Engine 3, giving it all he has. THE ROTORS ARE PROPELLING PROPERLY AND FAST. The HELICARRIER LEVELS itself.]
INSIDE THE SUIT
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Cap, I need the lever!
STEVE (V.O.): I need a minute here!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Lever. Now!
[Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the rotors, getting chewed up.]
EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY
[CAPTAIN AMERICA CLIMBS up the loose cable and reaches the railing. BARTON'S MAN opens fire once more. CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls himself up and finally PULLS the lever. A VENT opens up from Engine 3. IRON MAN falls out, but the suit heavily damaged, hardly keeping him up. IRON MAN heads for Cap. BARTON'S MAN turns his AIM to IRON MAN, who TACKLES him into the wall. IRON MAN rolls over, tired. Cap lets out a sigh of relief.]
OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
[The carrier that brought Barton and his team now leaves, taking Loki and his scepter. The carrier flies into the distance.]
*****
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY
[Fury runs in finding Agent Coulson still alive, barely.]
Agent Phil Coulson: Sorry, boss. They got rabbited.
Nick Fury: Just stay awake. EYES ON ME!
Agent Phil Coulson: No. I'm clocked out here.
Nick Fury: Not an option.
Agent Phil Coulson: It's okay, boss. This was never going to work... if they didn't have something... to…
[Agent Coulson looks away. Sighs his last breath. Nick Fury looks on grimly at Coulson. The medical team arrives.]
*****
INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY
NICK FURY (V.O.): Agent Coulson is down.
[Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on her headset, standing up.]
SHIELD AGENT (V.O.): Paramedics are on their way.
NICK FURY (V.O.): They're here.
INT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY
[Steve and Tony listen in as well.]
NICK FURY (V.O.): They called it.
*****
INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ LATER
[Fury gathers Tony and Steve back into the briefing room, everyone there has a look as if in a daze. A look of numb shock is shown on their devastated faces.]
Nick Fury: These were in Phil Coulson's jacket. Guess he never did get you to sign them.
[Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table towards Steve. Steve picks them up, STAINED WITH BLOOD.]
Nick Fury: We're dead in the air up here. Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that coming. (A BEAT) Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract. I never put all my chips on that number though, because I was playing something even riskier. There was an idea, Stark knows this, called THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE. The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea, in heroes.
[Tony gets up and walks off, not wanting to hear it anymore.]
Nick Fury: Well, it's an old fashioned notion.
*****
EXT. MEADOW ­ DAY
[Thor walks out far into the meadow. He looks down. MJÖLNIR.]
*****
INT. ABANDONED BUILDING ­ DAY
[Banner wakes up, in human form. He looks around and sees he is IN A PILE OF RUBBLE and looks up at the OPEN CEILING HE CRASHED IN. AND IS COMPLETELY NAKED. A SECURITY GUARD stands there, amazed.]
Security Guard: You fell out of the sky.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Did I hurt anybody?
Security Guard: There's nobody around here to get hurt. You did scare the hell out of some pigeons though.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Lucky.
Security Guard: Or just good aim. You were awake when you fell.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: You saw?
Security Guard: The whole thing, right through the ceiling. Big and green and buck ass nude. Here…
[He throws Banner a pair of big pants. Banner pulls on his pants.]
Security Guard: I didn't think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular size fella.
Bruce Banner / Hulk: Thank you.
Security Guard: Are you an alien?
Bruce Banner / Hulk: What?
Security Guard: From outer space, an alien?
Bruce Banner / Hulk: No.
Security Guard: Well then, son, you've got a condition.
*****
INT. HELICARRIER MEDICAL ROOM ­ DAY
[Barton is strapped down. Natasha watches over him as Barton tries to shake off Loki's mind control.]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Clint, you're gonna be alright.
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: You know that? Is that what you know? I got...I gotta go in though. I gotta flush him out.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: We don't have that long, it's gonna take time.
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: I don't understand. Have you ever had someone take your brain and play? Pull you out and send something else in? Do you know what it's like to be unmade?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: You know that I do.
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: Why am I back? How did you get him out?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Cognitive recalibration. I hit you really hard in the head.
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: Thanks. (Natasha unfastens the RESTRAINTS) Tasha, how many agents?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Don't. Don't do that to yourself, Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for.
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: Loki, he got away?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: I didn't need to know. I didn't ask. He's gonna make his play soon though. Today.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: We gotta stop him.
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: Yeah? Who's we?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: I don't know. Whoever's left.
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's eyesocket, I'd sleep better I suppose.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Now you sound like you.
[Natasha sits next to her partner and friend.]
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: But you don't. You're a spy, not a soldier. Now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: He didn't, I just… (SHE PAUSES)
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: Natasha.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: I've been compromised. I got red in my ledger. I'd like to wipe it out.
*****
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY
[Tony look at the empty cell container. He stands not saying a word. Steve walks in.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Was he married?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: No. There was a uh...cellist, I think.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: He was an idiot.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Why? For believing?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: For taking on Loki alone.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: He was doing his job.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have…
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: (WALKS AWAY) Right. How did that work for him?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Is this the first time you've lost a soldier?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: (turns around sharply) WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching to Fury's fife!
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Neither am I! He's got the same blood on his hands as Loki does. Right now we've got to put that aside and get this done. Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list…
Tony Stark / Iron Man: (looking at the blood stained wall) He made it personal.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: That's not the point.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: That is the point. That's Loki's point. He hit us all right where we live. Why?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: To tear us apart.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: He had to conquer his greed, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That's what he wants. He wants to beat us and he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Right, I caught his act at Stuttengard.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah. That's just a preview, this is opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered… (PAUSE) Sonofabitch!

[Steve walks in full uniform. Natasha looks at him, unprepared.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Time to go.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Go where?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly one of those jets?
[Barton walks out of the restroom. Looks at Cap.]
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: I can.
[Steve looks at Natasha and she nods her head to confirm Barton's on their side.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: You got a suit?
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: Yeah.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Then suit up.

[Fury looks the window of the ship, contemplating. Agent Hill walks up to him, knowing.]
Agent Maria Hill: Sir.
Nick Fury: Agent Hill?
Agent Maria Hill: Those cards, they were in Coulson's locker, not in his jacket.
Nick Fury: They needed the push. (holding Coulson's cards)
[A LOUD NOISE SCREECHES. Fury looks out to see IRON MAN flying off as well as the QUINJET.]
Nick Fury: They found it. Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do. I want eyes on everything.
Agent Maria Hill: Yes, sir.
*****
EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE - STARK TOWER ­ DAY
[IRON MAN arrives at STARK TOWER where Selvig, ACTIVATES the CMS device, holding the Tesseract.]
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Sir, I took off the arc reactor. The device is already self-sustained.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.
Dr. Erik Selvig: It's too late! It can't stop now. He wants to show us something! A new universe.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Okay.
[IRON MAN aims his hands toward the CMS and FIRES. The energy from his boosters SHATTERS with a deafening CRACK! Selvig falls backwards. DOWN BELOW, CITIZENS OF NEW YORK look up at STARK TOWER. IRON MAN stares in disbelief at the CMS ... unharmed.]
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: The barrier is pure energy. It's unbreachable. The Mark VII is not ready to be deployed.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock.
[TONY lands his SUIT and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits him. LOKI looks up at him, smiling. They proceed to walk into the penthouse.]
INT. STARK PENTHOUSE ­ DAY
[Loki walks in, holding the scepter. Tony casually walks down the steps, towards the bar.]
Loki: Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten you.
Loki: You should have left your armor on for that.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage. You've got the blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink?
Loki: Stalling me won't change anything.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You sure? I'm having one.
Loki: The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will change that. What have I to fear?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: THE AVENGERS. (Loki looks at him, confused) It's what we call ourselves, sort of like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES' type of thing.
Loki: Yes, I've met them.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: (SMILING) Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one. But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them.
Loki: That was the plan.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they'll come for you.
[From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE BRACELETS, a honing device.]
Loki: I have an army.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: We have a HULK.
Loki: I thought the beast had wandered off.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.
Loki: (slowly walks up to him; raising the scepter) How will your friends have time for me,when they're so busy fighting you?
[Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing. Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING.]
Loki: It should work.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Well, performance issues. You know? Not uncommon. One out of five…
[In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across the room.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Jarvis. Anytime now.
[Loki grabs Tony by the throat again.]
Loki: You will all fall before me.
[LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower. From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out. The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit. It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: And there's one other person you pissed off! His name was Phil.
[Loki raises the scepter. IRON MAN FIRES at Loki, sending him on his ass.]
EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

Loki: You can't. There is no stopping it. There is only the war!
Thor: So be it.

EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY
[They look up, out of their element. From both sides, CHITAURI SOLDIERS CLING OFF and attach themselves to the sides of the buildings, sliding down. Some CRASH into these buildings and begin FIRING from their ENERGY RIFLES at innocent people.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Stark, are you seeing this?
INSIDE THE SUIT
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm seeing, still working on believing. Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

Thor: No. We can. Together.
[Loki looks at his brother, showing a sign of hope. Then... Loki stabs Thor with a small knife. Thor keels over.]
Loki: Sentiment.
[Thor gets up, KICKS Loki and lifts him into the air. Thor then SLAMS him down, hard. Loki, bleeding, rolls over the edge. Thor looks down. LOKI IS RIDING ON A FLYING CHARIOT. DOZENS of CHITAURI follow his lead.]
*****
EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY
[The TRIO runs behind upside taxis. They look up and see Loki taking his band down the street and FIRES at the street IN A CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS. SMASHING CARS AND HURLING PEOPLE AS IT GOES IT GOES OFF IN ONE FINAL CONFLAGRATION. TERRIFIED PEOPLE running from Loki, looking over their shoulders, coming straight at us. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks down the bridge.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Those people need assistance down there.
[CHITAURI SOLDIERS that have landed near them and begin FIRING at them. BLACK WIDOW pulls both pistols and FIRES. Turns to Cap.]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: We got this. It's good. Go!
Steve Rogers / Captain America: (AT HAWKEYE) You think you can hold them off?
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: Captain. (pulls a trigger on his bow; an arrow is mechanically CHOSEN) It would be my genuine pleasure.

POLICE SERGEANT: National Guard? Does the army know what's happening here?
YOUNG COP: Do we?
[CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps in front of them. They look up at this ridiculous looking man.]
Steve Rogers / Captain America: I need men in these buildings. There are people inside that can run into the line of fire. You take them through the basement or through the subway. You keep them off the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.
POLICE SERGEANT: Why the hell should I take orders from you?
[Suddenly, an EXPLOSION comes up from behind Cap. An ENERGY BLAST is blocked by his SHIELD. TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS attack. The cops watch in shock as CAPTAIN AMERICA FIGHTS them off with ease. The Sergeant turns to his officer.]

Steve Rogers / Captain America: What's the story upstairs?
Thor: The power surrounding the cube is impenetrable.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Thor is right. We gotta deal with these guys.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: How do we do this?
Steve Rogers / Captain America: As a team.
Thor: I have unfinished business with Loki.
Clint Barton / Hawkeye: Yeah, get in line.
Steve Rogers / Captain America: Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight focused on us and that's what we need. Without him these things could run wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna need us…
[Just then, BANNER ARRIVES ON A SMALL MOTORBIKE. Getting off, he looks around the city.]
Bruce Banner / Hulk: So, this all seems horrible.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: I've seen worse.
