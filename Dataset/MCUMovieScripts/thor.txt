[On the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars. Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- a HAMMER-WIELDING BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind as a swirling breeze kicks up. A hint of what's to come. A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves down the street and heads out of town. The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point]
Jane Foster: Hurry! We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below. Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG  who emerges as well, rubbing his head.
Jane Foster: Oh-- watch your head.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Thanks. So what's this "anomaly" of yours supposed to look like?
Jane Foster: It's a little different each time. Once it looked like, I don't know, melted stars, pooling in a corner of the sky. But last week it was a rolling rainbow ribbon--
[SELVIG 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 1A.]
Jane Foster: Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and my gloves, will you? Intern DARCY LEWIS  hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.
Jane Foster: Not until you see it!
Dr. Erik Selvig:  I recognize those. Think how proud he'd be to see you now. Jane's grin fades to a sad smile.
Jane Foster: Thank you.
Dr. Erik Selvig: For what?
Jane Foster: The benefit of the doubt. The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2.]
Jane Foster: It's never taken this long before. Darcy calls up from the front seat.
Darcy Lewis: Can I turn on the radio?
Jane Foster:  Sure, if you like rocking out to KFRM, "All agriculture, all the time." Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.
[The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the frustrated Jane with sympathy.]
Jane Foster: The anomalies are always precipitated by geomagnetic storms. She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book, tracking occurrences and patterns.
Jane Foster: The last seventeen occurrences have been predictable to the minute... I just don't understand. Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror. She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert.
Darcy Lewis: Jane? Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of champagne begins to vibrate.
Jane Foster: There's got to be some new variable... Or an equipment malfunction... The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2A.]
Darcy Lewis: I don't think there's anything wrong with your equipment... The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3. They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane.]
Darcy Lewis: Jane?
Jane Foster: What?!
Darcy Lewis: I think you want to see this. Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over the desert --
[MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded.]
Jane Foster: Holy. Shatner.
Dr. Erik Selvig: That's your "subtle" aurora?!
Jane Foster: No-- yes! Let's go!
[The roof panels still open, the SUV races towards the strange event, Jane, amazed by the sight, stands with half her body out the roof, taking video of the light storm before them. The SUV hits a bump. Jane nearly flies out. Selvig grabs her, yanks her back in. Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline.]
Jane Foster: Isn't this great?! A thought strikes her.
Jane Foster: You're seeing it too, right? I'm not crazy?
Dr. Erik Selvig: That's debateable. Put your seat belt on!
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3A. The SUV lurches. Winds HOWL around the SUV now. Up ahead, spiraling down from out of the clouds comes -- 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 4. Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder. Jane clambers into the front seat, beside Darcy. She leans way out the window, TAPING the storm.]
Jane Foster: You've gotta get us closer so I can take a magnetic reading. Darcy laughs.
Darcy Lewis: Yeah, right! Good one!  Oh God, you're serious...
Jane Foster: You want those college credits or not?
[The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane leaning out the window, taping the event. The SUV disturbs two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past. The birds take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM! A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before them with a terrifying intensity. The SUV rocks from the blast. Darcy's had enough. She turns the wheel, starts to head away.]
Darcy Lewis: Keep the credits. I'll intern at Burger King.
Jane Foster: What are you doing?!
Darcy Lewis: Saving our lives! Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They struggle for control, when the headlights fall on --
[A MAN 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5. Directly in their path, stumbling through the winds. Darcy slams on the brakes, Jane turns the wheel hard to avoid him. The SUV swerves -- but too late. The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending him flying. The car SKIDS to a stop. Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard. They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through. A paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car. The three race from the SUV with flashlights. Jane spots the man lying on the ground. He's dressed in tattered clothing, charred and blackened.]
Darcy Lewis: I think that was legally your fault.
Jane Foster: Get the first aid kit. Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively. She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome, long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing the life back into him.
Jane Foster: Come on, big guy. Do me a favor and don't be dead, okay? Open your eyes and look at me. Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused, azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto them. For a moment, they each forget to breathe. The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5A.]
Darcy Lewis: Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I know CPR. A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels. She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist.
[JANE HIS EYES-- DARCY]
Jane Foster: --are dilating. That's a good sign.
Dr. Erik Selvig: We still have to get him to a hospital.
[JANE]
Dr. Erik Selvig: Immediately, Jane. Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE above their heads. A thought strikes her.
Jane Foster: Where did he come from? They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last glowing remnants of the storm, and into:
[EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard.]
Heimdall: Questions, they've always asked questions -- this race called man, on this planet they call earth. Passionately longing to know how they are connected to the heavens.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6. We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds, cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our galaxy.]
Heimdall: In ages past, they looked to us as gods, for indeed so many times we saved them from calamity. We tried to show them how their world was but one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos, linked to all others by the branches of Yggdrasil... We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense, sprawling, like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague shape of a TREE, its branches of glowing energy stretching out into the black void of space.
Heimdall: ...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in a universe of wonder, beauty, and terror that they barely comprehended. We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like a galaxy, slowly spinning before us.
Heimdall: But for all their thirst for knowledge, they let our lessons fall into myth and dreams. Where did he come from? He came from us, the proudest race of warriors the Worlds have ever seen. He came from this -- the greatest Realm the universe has ever known. We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then over and up, through a band of prismatic color to reveal what's on the other side:
Heimdall: He came... from Asgard!
[Beautiful beyond imagination. We fly over the magnificent landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city, modern yet timeless. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6A. The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm sprawled STANDS -- 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 7.]
Odin: Stares out at his kingdom. The ravens fly up to the balcony, land at his side.
[Odin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror.]
Odin: Do you think he's ready?
Frigga: He thinks he is. He has his father's confidence.
Odin: He'll need his father's wisdom.
Frigga: And his humility? Odin reacts.
Frigga: Thor won't be alone. Loki will be at his side to give him counsel. Have faith in your sons.
Odin: Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He could be a great King... Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating, trying to stop the strange event through the force of his sheer will.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8. Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more. A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own. ODIN (CONT'D)]
Frigga: For once, our son needs something we cannot provide.
Odin: I can fight it a little longer...
Frigga: No. You've put it off too long! I worry for you. He touches her cheek.
Odin: I've destroyed demons and monsters, devastated whole worlds, laid waste to mighty kingdoms, and still you worry for me?
Frigga: Always.
Odin: Not today. Now come kiss your king... while I'm still king. He pulls her close, and they kiss.
[Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the]
Thor: Another!
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8A. The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR. He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of]
the Hall.: We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then, from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his horned headpiece. Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded throne room.
[LOKI 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9.]
Thor: Have you ever known me to be nervous?
Loki: There was the time in Nornheim...
Thor: That wasn't nerves, brother. It was the rage of battle. How else could I have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive? The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for Thor.
Loki: As I recall, I was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease our escape.
Thor: Some do battle, others just do tricks. The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand. EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.
Thor: Loki... Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.
Thor: Now that was just a waste of good wine.
Loki: Just a bit of fun.  Right, my friend? The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED
[HELMET.]
Loki:  Nice feathers.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9A.]
Thor: You don't really want to start this again, do you, Cow?
Loki: I was being sincere!
Thor: You're incapable of sincerity.
Loki: Am I? He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.
Loki: I've looked forward to this day as long as you have. You're my brother and my friend. Sometimes I'm envious, but never doubt that I love you.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10. Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony. He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his brother's shoulder.]
Thor: Thank you. The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:
Loki: Give us a kiss.
Thor: Stop. Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.
Thor: How do I look?
Loki: Like a king. They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.
Loki: It's time.
Thor: You go ahead. Loki casts him a wary look.
Thor: I'll be along. Go on. Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.
[17A INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 17A VOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down. FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on dreamily.]
Fandral: Thank you, love. 
[(MORE) 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10A.]
Fandral: Now who'd like to polish my sword for me? The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands. HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and the ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor. Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the Attendant quickly backs away. From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then several HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS. We reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant. She eyes the weapons on the table.
Sif:  I'll miss you.
[Colorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the room, crowded with AESIR and REPRESENTATIVES from across Yggdrasil, all BUZZING with excitement. Thor's COMRADES enter and stride to their place of honor at the front of the hall. They are: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 11.]
Volstagg: I hope this goes quickly. I'm famished.
[FANDRAL]
Volstagg: Are you attached to that pretty face of yours? Because one more word, and you won't be.
Fandral:  My, we are hungry, aren't we? The others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral turns to him.
Fandral: Go on, Hogun. Smile. You can do it. Even you, Hogun the Grim. Just one smile. Hogun stares at him grimly.
Fandral: All right, half a smile. Look, forget the smile, just show some teeth.
Sif: Fandral, is it true the famous Warriors Three are ready to meet any challenge?
Fandral: Name it, Lady Sif.
Sif: Keep your mouth shut.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12. Imposing EINHERJAR GUARDS clad in armor, swords at the ready, stand watch inside the massive underground structure beneath]
the palace.: A cold BREEZE blows past them.
[19A INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 19A Thor stands, his fingers nervously drumming the handle of his hammer. Frigga approaches behind him, sees his anxiety.]
Frigga: It's all right to be nervous.
Thor: Why does everyone keep saying that? I'm not nervous!
Frigga: You may be able to fool the rest of
[ASGARD --]
Thor: ...but never you. I know.
Frigga: Thor, just remember that you have something even the great Allfather never had.
Thor: And what is that?
Frigga: Me for a mother. She smiles.
Frigga: Now don't keep your father waiting. Frigga leaves.
[Sif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd. Loki and Frigga enter. Loki takes his place at the front of the hall alongside the others. With another blast of the horn, the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves into formation. They part to reveal -- ODIN 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12A. Sitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He holds his spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace of weakness in him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a]
Volstagg:  Where is he?
Loki: He said he'd be along. Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.
Volstagg: What?
Sif: He wants to make an entrance.
Fandral: Well, if he doesn't show up soon, he shouldn't bother. Odin looks like he's ready to feed him to his ravens.
Loki: I wouldn't worry. Father will forgive him. He always does.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13. Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the lower level --]
MJOLNIR: Roars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall behind it, catching it behind his back. The CROWD erupts in CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy.
Sif: Oh, please. Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.
[As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father. Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at her. She can't help but smile. Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM. The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless]
authority.: He raises Gungnir before him.
Odin: Gungnir. Its aim is true, its power strong. With it I have defended Asgard and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms since the time of the Great Beginning. And though the day has come for a new King to wield his own weapon -- that duty remains the same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my first-born.
[(MORE) 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13A.]
Odin: So long entrusted with this mighty hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the heart of a dying star, from the sacred metal of Uru. Only one may lift it. Only one is worthy. Who wields this hammer commands the lightning and the storm. Its power has no equal -- as a weapon, to destroy, or as a tool, to build. It is a fit companion for a King.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 14. The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large]
and BLUE-SKINNED.: One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns to go. But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something standing in the shadows behind it. As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them. They turn back around. Now it's their turn to SCREAM.
[The Ceremony continues.]
Odin: Today I entrust you with the greatest honor in all the Nine Realms. The sacred throne of Asgard. I have sacrificed much to achieve peace. So, too, must a new generation sacrifice to maintain that peace. Responsibility, duty, honor. These are not merely virtues to which we must aspire. They are essential to every soldier and to every King. The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the hall. Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son with pride.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 15.]
Odin: Thor Odinson, do you swear to guard the Nine Realms?
Thor: I swear.
Odin: Do you swear to preserve the peace?
Thor: I swear.
Odin: Do you swear to cast aside all selfish ambition and pledge yourself only to the good of all the Realms? Beat.
Thor: I swear.
Odin: Then on this day, I, Odin Allfather, proclaim you-- Odin hesitates, noticing a strange sight before him. ICE creeps across the surface of the large banners around the hall, making an eerie CRACKING sound. Thor, his comrades, and the crowd see it too.
[ODIN (CONT'D) 24A OMITTED SCENE MOVED BELOW 24A 25 OMITTED SCENE COMBINED WITH SCENE 25B BELOW 25 25A OMITTED 25A 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16. 25B INT. VAULT - DAY 25B Thor enters, then stares shocked at the sight before him. Sif, the Warriors Three, and Loki hurry in behind Thor and]
stop short.: Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the floor. We don't see the blue-skinned bodies of the Frost Giants clearly, just catch glimpses of their twisted and smoldering remains on the floor. They've just lost a savage battle. Badly. Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the black metal creature, a fiery glow coming from within it. It is THE DESTROYER. It holds the Casket in its hands.
Sif: The Destroyer.
[VOLSTAGG]
Fandral: I've never been inside the Vault before. It's said the Tesseract was once held here.
[VOLSTAGG]
Sif: Shush! Odin surveys the destruction.
Thor: The Jotuns must pay for what they've done!
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16A.]
Odin: They have paid with their lives. The Destroyer did its job, and the Casket is safe. All is well.
Thor: "All is well?!" They broke into the Weapons Vault! If the Frost Giants had stolen even one of these
[RELICS--]
Odin: But they didn't.
Thor: I want to know why they--
[ODIN]
Thor: And if you hadn't taken it from them they would have laid waste to all the Nine Realms!
Odin: I have a truce with Laufey, the Jotun King.
Thor: He just broke your truce! We must act! Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three.
Odin: Leave us. Thor's comrades exit. Odin eyes Thor, as Loki watches.
Odin: And what action would you take?
Thor: March into Jotunheim as you once did, teach them a lesson, break their spirits so they'll never dare try to cross our borders again!
Odin: You're thinking only as a warrior!
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16B.]
Thor: This was an act of war!
Odin: It was the act of but a few, doomed to fail.
Thor: They got this far!
Odin: We will find the breach in our defenses. It will be found, and it will be sealed.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 17.]
Thor: As King of Asgard, I would--
Odin: You are not King. Not yet. Thor sees in his father's face that he's pushed this as far as he can. He backs away, then leaves, pushing through the doors so hard that they SLAM backwards behind him. Odin watches him go.
[Thor stands in the empty hall, bearing the signs of the festivities cancelled due to the events of the day. Anger and frustration rising within him, Thor upends one of the]
massive tables.: From across the room, Loki watches him.
[AT THE BANQUET HALL ENTRANCE Sif, Fandral, and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in search of his dinner.]
Sif: Redecorating, are we? Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast.
Volstagg: What's this -- ?!
Hogun: I told you they'd cancel it.
Fandral: We thought that was just you being your normal cheery self. Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing.
Volstagg: All this food -- so innocent, cast to the ground. It breaks the heart! Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki calmly moves towards him.
Thor: It's unwise to be in my company right now, brother.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 18.]
Loki: Who said I was wise?
Thor:  This was to be my day of triumph.
Loki: It will come. In time.
Thor: Yes, exactly!
Loki: But there's nothing we can do without defying Father. Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye. Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned.
Loki: No... stop there! I know that look!
Thor: It's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders.
Loki: It's madness!
Volstagg: Madness? What sort of madness?
Loki: Nothing! Thor was making a jest!
Thor: The safety of our Realm is no jest. We're going to Jotunheim.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19.]
Fandral: What?!
Sif: Thor, of all the laws of Asgard, this is one you must not break. Loki looks on, intrigued by the proceedings.
Fandral: This isn't like a journey to Earth, where you summon a little lightning and thunder and the mortals worship you as a god. This is Jotunheim.
Volstagg: And if the Frost Giants don't kill you, your Father will!
Thor: My father fought his way into Jotunheim, defeated their armies, and took their Casket! We'd just be looking for answers.
Sif: It is forbidden! 
[Thor sizes up his friends, smiles. He proceeds to make his case with enthusiasm and charismatic conviction.]
Thor: My friends, have you forgotten all that we've done together? He turns to Fandral.
Thor: Who brought you into the sweet embrace of the most exotic maidens in all of Yggdrasil?
Fandral: You did.
[THOR 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19A.]
Volstagg: You did.
Hogun: You did. He turns to Sif.
Thor: And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this Realm has ever known?
Sif: I did.
[THOR]
Thor: Come on. You're not going to let my brother and me take all the glory, are you? Loki looks startled.
Loki: What?
Thor: You are coming with me...
Loki: Yes, of course! I won't let my brother march into Jotunheim alone. I will be at his side.
Volstagg: And I.
Fandral: And I.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20.]
Hogun: And I. The Warriors Three fight together.
Sif: I fear we'll live to regret this.
Volstagg: If we're lucky.
[Thor, Sif, Loki, and the Warriors Three walk from the Palace, across the grounds. They reach a group of ATTENDANTS who ready their battle gear for their journey. Loki slips away from the group, speaks to a nearby GUARD. Hogun notices.]
Thor: We must first find a way to get past Heimdall.
Volstagg: That will be no easy task. It's said the Gatekeeper can see a single dew drop fall from a blade of grass a thousand worlds away.
Fandral: And he can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim.
Volstagg: Jest not! He heareth all!
Fandral: Please. Getting past him should be simple enough now, since he seems to be letting Frost Giants sneak by under his nose. Volstagg, terrified, calls out to the sky.
Volstagg: Forgive him! He meaneth no offense! Loki rejoins the group as Thor leads them onward.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20A. Thor and his band of adventurers, on horseback, pass through the massive Gate, leaving Asgard behind. They ride along the most astounding path in this Realm or any other -- THE RAINBOW BRIDGE. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 21. Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to the mists and black void of space beyond. In the distance far ahead, the Bridge continues on until it reaches Heimdall's Observatory. The band draws near the Observatory, where HEIMDALL himself, Gatekeeper of Asgard, stands at his post on the Bridge before them, blocking their way, staring them down. There is something other-worldly about him, even for this Realm. He holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern, intimidating face virtually concealed by armor. Something glints beneath his visor, like twinkling stars.]
Loki: Keep your weapons sheathed and your mouths closed. This is going to take subtlety and sincerity, not brute strength. Leave it to me. Loki dismounts and steps forward.
[LOKI (CONT'D) GOOD HEIMDALL--]
Heimdall: You're not dressed warmly enough. Thor, Loki, and the others trade looks.
Loki: I'm sorry?
Heimdall: The freezing cold of Jotunheim. It will kill you all in time, even Thor.
Heimdall: Or can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim? Fandral looks gob-smacked.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 22.]
Fandral: That was just a bit of a jest, really... Loki goes into damage control.
Loki: You must be mistaken. We're not--
[THOR]
Heimdall: For ages have I guarded Asgard and kept it safe from those who would do it harm. In all that time, never has an enemy slipped by my watch -- until this day. I wish to know how that happened.
Thor: Then tell no one where we've gone until we've returned. Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles him.
Volstagg: What happened? Your silver tongue turn to lead?
Loki: Get me off this bridge before it cracks under your girth. Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.
[Thor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a platform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus at the center of the room and readies the Observatory. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23.]
Heimdall: Be warned. I will honor my sworn oath to protect this Realm as its Gatekeeper. If your return threatens the safety of Asgard, Bifrost will remain closed to you. You'll be left to die in the cold wastes of Jotunheim.
Thor: I have no plans to die today.
Heimdall: None do. Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the apparatus of the Observatory starts up.
[The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into the Observatory. Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES, the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it. The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor and his five comrades stand.]
Heimdall: All is ready. You may pass.
Volstagg: Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us?
Heimdall: To keep this bridge open would unleash the full power of the Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.
Volstagg: Ah. Never mind, then. Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others, grins.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23A.]
Thor: Come on. Don't be bashful. The others join him at his side, then step towards the Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom, changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked off the platform and inside the vortex.
[A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are imprinted on the ice around them. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 24. Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.]
Thor: Come on, big fella. Up...! With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:
Volstagg: This belt! This belt is now my lucky belt! I will never remove it! Even when bathing!
Fandral: You bathe? Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun city lies in the distance.
Hogun: We shouldn't be here.
Thor: Too late now.
Fandral: Actually, it's not. We could turn right around, hop back to Asgard, share a mug by the fire. Could be nice. Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious.
Loki: Perhaps we should wait. Thor turns back to his brother.
Thor: For what?
Loki: To survey the enemy. To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25.]
Volstagg: I'm liking that. Gauging, surveying. Particularly the distance part.
Thor: We know all we must. It's time to act. Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow.
Sif: He's just got to swing his hammer...
[The group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland, shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold. Loki looks around them, anxious. Volstagg shivers. Thor, invigorated, turns back to his comrades.]
Thor: It feels good, doesn't it? To be together again, adventuring on another world?
Fandral: Adventuring? Is that what we're doing?
Thor: What would you call it?
Fandral: Freezing.
Volstagg: Starving.
Sif: Whining.
Thor: How about a song to lift our spirits? The others groan.
Hogun: No, not that!
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25A.]
Sif: Please don't make us sing again!
Fandral: If I have to listen to Volstagg's singing voice one more time, I'll fall on my own sword!
Sif: Well, now I'm on board. She and Thor share a grin. The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling, ravaged by warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies before them, across a central plaza.
Sif: Where are they?
Thor: Hiding. As cowards always do. Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza. Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.
[The party reaches the plaza. They sense the Frost Giants in the shadows and crevices, surrounding them now on all sides. The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons. A JOTUN SENTRY calls to him.]
Laufey: What is your business here, Asgardian? The Jotun's voice itself sounds like cracking ice.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 26.]
Thor: I speak only to your King. Not to his foot soldiers.
Laufey: Then speak. 
[Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple, where LAUFEY sits, veiled in shadow, behind a cascading waterfall. The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and his people have endured.]
Laufey: I am Laufey, King of this Realm.
Thor: And I am--
Laufey: We know who you are, Odinson. Why have you brought the stench of your blood into my world?
Thor: I demand answers. Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together.
Laufey: You "demand?"
Thor: How did your people get into Asgard?
Laufey: The house of Odin is full of traitors. Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look, disturbed by the Jotun King's words.
Thor: Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies.
Laufey: Your father is a murderer and a thief. He stole what was ours, and left our world in ruins. We have the right to reclaim the Casket.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 27.]
Thor: Not when you'd use it to make war against other Realms. Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.
Laufey: And why have you come here? To make peace? You long for battle. You crave it. I see you for what you are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but a boy, trying to prove himself a man.
Thor: This boy has grown tired of your mockery. Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores him.
Loki: Thor, stop and think. Look around you. We are outnumbered.
Thor: Know your place, brother...
Laufey: You should listen to his counsel. You know not what your actions would unleash. Laufey steps out of the shadows.
Laufey: But I do. Go now, while I still allow it. Thor simmers. Loki speaks up.
Loki: We will accept your most gracious offer. The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant nearby mutters under his breath.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28.]
Laufey: Run back home, little princess. Thor stops in his tracks. Loki goes white. He knows what's coming.
Loki: Damn. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor. Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.
Volstagg: Silly hammer! Has a mind of its own! ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR around them, extending off the ends of their arms like SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.
Fandral: I'm hoping that's just decorative. Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost Giant. His comrades form another circle around him, separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He's enjoying this.
Thor: Next! Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.
Fandral: Well? What move, do you think?
Volstagg: I say we use "The Norn's Revenge."
Fandral: At this close range? I think "The Alfheim Lunge" is a better move.
[VOLSTAGG 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28A.]
Hogun: Shut up! Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle. A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and hoists himself up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun with his mace. Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground.
Sif: If you don't treat me like a lady, I won't act like a lady! She takes out the Jotun. Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he's vulnerable, swipes at him. But the Jotun's arm passes right through him. The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.
Loki:  Pathetic. He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at once. Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE. The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back. Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.
Thor: Come on! At least make it a challenge for me! He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor rises, grins.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28B.]
Thor: Now that's more like it! He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute head over heels. Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies back to his grasp.
Thor:  Ugly and stupid. Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the ground by another. It raises its weapon above her. Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in the chest. The Jotun falls dead.
Sif:  I'm so glad I taught him how to do that! Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good hits in.
Volstagg: You may want to put some ice on that! The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind. Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.
Volstagg: You may be taller, but I'm wider! Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him flying. Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and sending him crashing to the ground.
Volstagg: It's not too late for you to surrender. Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28C. Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's ice helmet and dropping him to the ground. Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes out a small FLASK. Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells to his comrades.]
Volstagg: Don't let them grab hold of you! He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the battle. Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword stops mid ice layer. The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face, and the warrior drops to one knee. Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.
Volstagg:  Thank you, my lady. But I nearly had him!
Sif: Of course you did. Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them out.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29. A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH- FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground. Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he goes.]
Volstagg: Hang on! Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously close to hacking into Hogun's legs.
Hogun: Watch the legs!
[VOLSTAGG]
Fandral: You really think your icicles are a match for Asgardian steel? Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade away.
Fandral: Fair enough. Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's sword and snaps it in half.
Fandral: Could we stop just a moment while I get another sword? Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant through with his own weapon. The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air, forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral, rendering him helpless.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29A. Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly- unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights]
them off.: Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.
Volstagg: That's unfortunate. He hurries to his wounded comrade.
Fandral: I may need a bit of help. Not a good look, is it?
Volstagg: Just try not to bleed.
Fandral: How's the face?
Volstagg: Flawless. Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice stalagmite. Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost Giants. The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm. Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused. The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the distraction, KICKS the Giant.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 30. Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts the Jotuns around him.]
Thor: Come on! But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon. Mjolnir falls to the ground. A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the ground, to no avail. Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to leave. From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the wall of the palace, and down to the ground below. The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their feet.
Loki: That can't be good.
Volstagg: Yes, it could! Might be an early spring! They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle. Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 31.]
Loki: Thor, we must go! Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat of battle.
Thor: Then go!
Sif: There are too many of them!
Thor: I can stop them! The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all around them.
Sif: Thor! But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.
Volstagg: Run! Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give chase. Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them. The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a
[MOMENT --]
[THOR'S FIST Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns. He opens his hand, beckoning. One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground with all his might. KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.]
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32. But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground beneath them, exposing the black void of space below.]
Volstagg: What's Thor done?
Loki: Likely killed us all! As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them. The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not move, for fear of falling through, into the void below. Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his comrades.
[35A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 35A Thor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists.]
Thor: Loki, we have to see. Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating. But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too many, even for a Thunder God.
[VOLSTAGG]
ODIN ALLFATHER: Astride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad in battle armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an imposing sight.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32A. The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks, stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians. Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath his feet raises him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face-]
Odin: Laufey. End this.
Laufey: Your boy sought this out.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33.]
Odin: You're right. These are the actions of a boy. Treat them as such. You and I can stop this before there's further bloodshed. Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice blade at the end of his arm.
Laufey: We are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather. He'll get what he came for -- war and death. Odin looks grim, determined.
Odin: So be it. Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet. The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the fleeing Jotuns with delight.
Thor: Now! We'll finish them together!
Odin: Silence! Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent. Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.
[Heimdall stands at the Observatory controls. Odin pulls Heimdall's sword from the control panel and throws it to him. Heimdall backs away.]
Thor: Why did you bring us back?
Odin: Do you realize what you've done? What you've started?
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33A.]
Thor: I was protecting my home.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 34.]
Odin: You cannot protect your friends. How can you hope to protect a kingdom? Odin turns to the others.
[ODIN (CONT'D)]
Thor: There won't be a kingdom to protect if you're afraid to act! Odin stares at him.
Thor: Whatever the cost, the world must know that the new King of Asgard will not be held in contempt.
Odin: That's pride and vanity that talks! Not leadership! Have you forgotten everything I've taught you? What of a warrior's patience, cunning?
Thor: While you wait and be patient, the Nine Realms laugh at us! The old ways are done. You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls!
Odin: You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy!
Thor: And you are an old man and a fool! The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words. Odin falls quiet. When he speaks again, there's something terrifying beneath the calmness of his words.
Odin: A fool, yes! I was a fool to think you were ready. Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 34A. LOKI]
Loki: Father!
[Odin turns and gives Loki a look which stops him in his tracks.]
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35.]
Odin: Thor Odinson... You have disobeyed the express command of your King. Through your arrogance and stupidity, you have opened these peaceful Realms and innocent lives to the horrors of war. The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory's control panel. The turret turns, the Bifrost energy building along with Odin's rage. It FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the end of the platform, creating a portal behind Thor. Odin turns angrily to his son.
Odin: You are unworthy of this Realm... Odin RIPS a disc off Thor's chest.
Odin: ...unworthy of your title... He rips away Thor's cloak.
Odin: ...unworthy of the loved ones you've betrayed. I hereby take from you your powers. Odin extends his hand towards his son. Mjolnir goes flying from Thor's grasp into Odin's hand.
Odin: In the name of my father... A FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the hammer and hits Thor, disintegrating the right arm of his armor and part of the chest piece.
Odin: ...and of his father before... Another strike disintegrates the remainder of Thor's armor, including the cape and torn-away disc on the floor.
Odin: I cast you out! Odin thrusts Mjolnir before him and -- with a CRACK OF THUNDER -- Thor is hurled backwards into the open Bifrost and disappears in the vortex.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35A. Odin holds Mjolnir in his hand, stares at it bitterly. He closes his eyes, lost in contemplation, whispers something quietly. ODIN (CONT'D) CUT TO BLACK. Thor opens his eyes, surrounded by darkness. Suddenly, he's blinded by bright headlights of a vehicle -- an SUV. It swerves, the side of it coming straight at him. It SLAMS into him, as we: CUT TO BLACK. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36. After a beat, we hear familiar voices.]
Darcy Lewis: I think that was legally your fault.
Jane Foster: Get the first aid kit.
Thor: Thor opens his eyes to see Jane Foster staring at him, concerned. She looks vulnerable and beautiful.
Darcy Lewis: Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I know CPR.
[END THOR'S POV JANE]
Jane Foster: Uh, thanks. Are you okay? Thor searches the ground.
Thor: Hammer...
Darcy Lewis: Yeah, we can tell you're hammered. That's pretty obvious. Jane notices something on the ground around them. She shines her flashlight down at the sand.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36A.]
Jane Foster: Erik... look at this. He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible pattern is etched into the sand. They exchange a look. Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and snaps some photos of the runes. A breeze begins to blow them away.
Jane Foster: We've got to move fast before anything changes.
[(MORE) 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37.]
Jane Foster: We need soil samples, light readings, everything. She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some readings, jots them down in her notebook. Selvig looks at Thor, who stares up at the sky.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Jane, we need get him to a hospital. Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the cannister.
Jane Foster: Not right now. It'll take too long. County's an hour away. We'll drop him off after we're done here. Selvig looks uncertain.
[JANE (CONT'D)]
Thor: Father! Heimdall! I know you can hear me! Open the bridge!
Jane Foster:  Okay, you and Darcy take him to the hospital, I'll stay here.
Dr. Erik Selvig: You expect me to leave you alone in the middle of the desert? Thor turns to the others, frustrated.
Thor: You! What world is this? The group is intimidated by his fervor.
Dr. Erik Selvig: It's all right, my friend. We're going to get you some help. Selvig touches Thor's shoulder. Thor shoves him off, grows agitated, belligerent.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37A.]
Thor: Where am I?! Answer me! Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it. Jane looks on, concerned.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 38.]
Jane Foster: Erik, just back away...
Dr. Erik Selvig:  You're in the desert outside the town of Puente Antiguo.
Thor: What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?
Darcy Lewis: Uh... New Mexico? Darcy raises a TASER at him. Thor looks at the weapon, unsure what to make of it.
Thor: You dare threaten Thor with so puny
[Darcy fires, the electrified wires shooting out of the taser, ZAPPING him in the chest. Thor convulses, falls to the ground unconscious. Jane and Selvig stare at her, shocked.]
Darcy Lewis: What? He was freaking me out.
[As Jane still takes soil samples, Darcy and Selvig struggle to drag an unconscious Thor to the SUV and lift him inside. SELVIG The SUV heads off into the distance. Behind it, high overhead, a HOLE opens in the sky. A last blast of Bifrost energy bursts forth from it, and a small OBJECT comes firing into our world. It BURNS across the desert sky like a meteor. 40 OMITTED 40 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 39. The SUV sits parked before the emergency room entrance. Selvig watches the unconscious Thor with interest as two ORDERLIES set the Asgardian onto a gurney. Jane and Darcy stand before a sweet, ditzy ADMISSIONS NURSE.]
Admissions Nurse: Name?
Jane Foster: He said it was "Thor." The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer, one key at a time. Jane watches as Thor is wheeled out of the room.
[ADMISSIONS NURSE]
Jane Foster: I've never met him before.
Darcy Lewis: Until she hit him with the car.
Jane Foster: Grazed him, actually.
[ADMISSIONS NURSE]
Jane Foster: I told you, I don't know him. I just want to make sure he's okay.
Admissions Nurse: I'm going to need a name and contact number.
Jane Foster: Jane Foster.
[ADMISSIONS NURSE (TYPING SLOWLY) J...A...N... 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 39A.]
Dr. Erik Selvig: Oh, for God's sake... He reaches over Jane's shoulder and hands the Nurse his business card.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Here. Let's go. Selvig, Darcy, and Jane head out.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 40. Thor, now in a hospital gown, winces in pain as he awakens on a gurney to find a NURSE standing over him, a syringe in his arm.]
Nurse: Hi. Just taking a little blood. 
[Thor SLAPS the syringe away angrily, starts to sit up.]
Thor: How dare you attack the son of Odin!
Nurse: I need some help! 
[Two ORDERLIES race over, try to hold Thor down.]
Nurse: We're trying to help you!
Thor: Then bring me a healing stone, you savages! He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all struggling to hold Thor down. Medical equipment goes flying, furniture overturned.
Orderly: What the hell is this guy on? 
[Finally, they force him back down onto the gurney. Thor looks shocked and amazed that he's actually being overpowered by this small group. The NURSE injects him with a sedative.]
Thor: You're no match for the Mighty-- Thor struggles a beat, then passes out.
[Smoke rises from a fifty foot wide CRATER. A TOWNIE pulls his pick-up to a stop at the crater's edge. He climbs out, peers down below, his curiosity piqued by what he sees.]
Townie: Huh.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 40A. The Townie approaches something at the center of the crater. We don't see what it is, but it bathes him in an otherworldly, BLUE LUMINOUS GLOW. He reaches for the object, tries to lift it, but can't. He redoubles his efforts, strains with all his might, with no luck. He takes off his hat, fans himself, stares at the mysterious object. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41.]
Townie: Huh.
[The distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light. Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast desert. He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment. A printer churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the Bifrost footage. Darcy hangs them on the wall. Selvig surveys the scene, watches how Jane works, impressed. He notices a monitor which displays a complex program entitled "J. FOSTER ALGORITHM ANALYSIS". He looks proud. The three of them have been up all night, fueled by caffeine and excitement.]
Jane Foster: Darcy, when you're done, take the soil samples to Professor Meyers in geology. Remind him, he owes me.
Dr. Erik Selvig: We might want to perform a spectral analysis.
Jane Foster: "We?"
Dr. Erik Selvig: I flew all the way out here -- might as well make myself useful. This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up, inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a rack-mounted server.
Jane Foster: You know what would be really useful? Do you still have that friend at LIGO?
Dr. Erik Selvig: She was more than a friend.
Jane Foster: Could you call in a favor?
Dr. Erik Selvig: You don't think this was just a magnetic storm?
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41A.]
Jane Foster: If I'm right, their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night's event.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Meaning? Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.
Jane Foster: Meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger.
Dr. Erik Selvig: How "big" are we talking about? Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and covered with stars.
Jane Foster: I think the lensing around the edges is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
Darcy Lewis: A what?
Dr. Erik Selvig: I thought you were a science major.
Darcy Lewis: Political Science. Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.
Jane Foster: She was the only applicant.
[SELVIG JANE 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41B. Selvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the monitor.]
Jane Foster: Erik, look...
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42. Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen through the "bubble" in the clouds.]
Jane Foster: What do you see here?
Dr. Erik Selvig: Stars.
Jane Foster: Yes. But not our stars. She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her excitement.
Jane Foster: This is the star alignment for our quadrant, this time of year. So unless Ursa Minor decided to take the day off... those are someone else's constellations. Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself. Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the image catches her eye.
Darcy Lewis: Hey, check it out. Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Is that...?
Jane Foster: I think I left something at the hospital. As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape of a MAN.
[45A EXT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 45A At the top of the palace, we see a small FIGURE on the balcony. As we move closer, we see it is a burdened Odin, looking out over Asgard. Frigga enters to find Odin standing lost in thought. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42A.]
Frigga: How could you have done this?
Odin: Do you understand what he set in motion? He's taken us to the brink of war!
Frigga: But banishment? You would lose him forever? He's your son!
Odin: What would you have done?
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43.]
Frigga: I would not have exiled him to a world of mortals, stripped of his powers, to suffer alone. I would not have had the heart for such cruelty!
Odin: That is why I'm King.
Frigga: You can bring him back.
Odin: No. His fate is in his own hands now.
[Thor awakens on a hospital bed. He notices RESTRAINTS on his wrists now. He pulls at them, tries to free himself, to no avail.]
Thor: It's not possible. He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands slips free from its restraint.
[47A INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL ER - DAY 47A Jane again faces the Admissions Nurse, with Selvig and Darcy nearby.]
Admissions Nurse: I'm sorry, only relatives can visit patients.
[JANE]
Admissions Nurse: I thought you said you didn't know him.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43A.]
Jane Foster: I meant I barely know him anymore. The man he's become. He's changed. I mean, what woman really knows her husband, anyway?
Admissions Nurse: None of us, dear. He's in Room
[Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head down the corridor, passing the destruction of the ER Thor wrecked the previous night. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 44. They enter Thor's room. They step inside to find Thor's bed empty. Jane, Selvig, and Darcy quickly climb into Jane's SUV. Jane starts the car, frustrated.]
Jane Foster: Typical. I just lost my most important piece of evidence.
Darcy Lewis: So now what?
Jane Foster: We find him.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Did you see what he did in there? I don't know if finding him is the best idea.
Jane Foster: I want to know what that thing was, and he may have the answers. We don't have a choice.
Darcy Lewis: Oo-kay. She pulls out her taser and a can of mace.
Dr. Erik Selvig: So we're just going to spend the rest of the day looking for him?
Jane Foster: However long it takes. Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --
BAM!: She collides with Thor again, dressed in stolen hospital scrubs. Jane and Selvig exchange a look.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 44A. Jane and Selvig emerge from the SUV, help Thor to his feet.]
Jane Foster: I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not doing that on purpose.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45. Thor looks up at the sky.]
Thor: Blue sky... one sun... This is Earth, isn't it?
Darcy Lewis: I think you may have hit him with the car one time too many.
[JANE Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell- shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a]
Volstagg: We should never have let him go.
Sif: There was no stopping him.
Fandral: At least he's only banished, not dead. Which is what we'd all be if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone.
Volstagg: How did the guard even know? Loki stares at his arm.
Loki: I told him.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45A.]
Fandral: What?
Loki: I told him to go to Odin after we'd left. Though he should be flogged for taking so long.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46.]
Volstagg: You told the guard?
Loki: I saved our lives! And Thor's. I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.
Sif: Loki, you're the only one who can help Thor now. You must go to the Allfather and convince him to change his mind!
Loki: And if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous. You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from its King? The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He leaves the room. Hogun stares after him.
Sif: He may speak about the good of Asgard, but he's always been jealous of Thor.
Volstagg: True, but we should be grateful to him. He did save our lives.
Hogun: Laufey said there were traitors in the House of Odin. The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun.
Fandral: Why is it every time you choose to speak, it has to be something dark and ominous?
Hogun: A master of magic could easily bring three Jotuns into Asgard. The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication.
Volstagg: No! Surely not!
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46A.]
Fandral: Loki's always been one for mischief, but you're talking about something else entirely.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 47.]
Sif: Who else could elude Heimdall's gaze with tricks of light and shadow?
Volstagg: The ceremony was interrupted just before Thor was named King.
Sif: We should go to the Allfather.
Fandral: And tell him what? "Oh, by the way, we think your son just betrayed the throne. And do us a favor. Bring back Thor. There's a good fellow!"
Sif: It's our duty. If any of our suspicions are right, then all of Asgard is in danger.
[Loki heads into the Vault, sees the Casket of Ancient Winters sitting on its stand. He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it between his forearms off its pedestal. As he does, a blueness spreads from his arms, across his body. The latticework behind the Casket starts to separate, the Destroyer rousing. A fire starts to glow within its black metal armor, as it rattles to life, but Loki ignores it -- the blueness spreading further, consuming his whole body. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48.]
Odin: Stop! Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it. Odin eyes Loki with dismay.
Loki: Am I cursed?
Odin: No. Put the Casket down. Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly returning to its normal form and color. He stares at his father.
Loki: What am I?
Odin: You're my son.
Loki: What more than that? Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened. Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth.
Loki: The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it? Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer.
Odin: No.
Loki: Laufey's son... He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48A.]
Loki: Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun blood. Why would you take me?
Odin: You were an innocent child.
Loki: You took me for a purpose, what was it? Odin doesn't answer.
Loki: Tell me!
Odin: I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day, bring about an alliance, bring about a permanent peace... through you. But those plans no longer matter.
Loki: So I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me.
Odin: Why do you twist my words?
Loki: You could have told me what I was from the beginning. Why didn't you?
Odin: You are my son. My blood. I wanted only to protect you from the truth.
Loki: Because I am the monster parents tell their children about at night?
Odin: Don't...
Loki: It all makes sense now. Why you favored Thor all these years.
Odin: Listen...
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48B.]
Loki: Because no matter how much you claim to "love" me, you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the Throne of Asgard! Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of the Odinsleep approaching. Loki doesn't notice as Odin tries to fight it off.
Odin: Listen to me! Loki strides away towards the exit.
Odin: Loki! Odin starts towards him, when the enormous mental, emotional, and physical strain of recent events finally takes its toll. The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him. His entire body now moves out of sync with the rest of the world, leaving trails behind him as he staggers backwards. Odin falls back against a wall, his face contorting in a scream. He collapses to the stone floor. Loki, shocked, hurries to him. He takes Odin in his arms, calls out.
Loki: Guards!
[55 OMITTED 55 56 OMITTED 56 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 49. 57 OMITTED MERGED WITH SCENE 54 57 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 50. Cars, pick-ups, and SUVs are parked around the crater, the sound of a BOISTEROUS PARTY coming from within. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 51. It looks like the whole town has turned out. LOCALS sit on lounge chairs, drink beer from coolers, laugh and talk. They watch the center of the crater, where LARGE MEN have formed a line to take a turn with the mysterious object. One of them struggles and fails to lift it. As he gives up, the next man steps up and takes his turn, straining from the effort. Other Townies SNAP PICTURES of the scene with their]
cell phones.: They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a path as a large PICK-UP TRUCK backs its way down the crater's edge. An EAGER TOWNIE hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain from the back of the truck. He fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes the chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage.
EAGER TOWNIE: This'll do it. He yells to the driver.
EAGER TOWNIE: Okay, let 'er rip! The townsfolk watch as the pick-up's engine ROARS, then STRAINS, its wheels spinning futilely, until finally the rear of the truck, along with the back wheels and axles, break off and go flying. People dive out of the way. The PICK-UP DRIVER sticks his head out. He is STAN "THE MAN" LEE. He looks back, shocked. The townsfolk laugh, the party continuing. They don't notice as --
[ON THE CRATER'S EDGE ABOVE THEM An imposing GOVERNMENT VEHICLE pulls up to a stop. A Fed in a suit climbs out, peers down at the boisterous gathering below, his eyes fixed on the object at the center of the]
crater.: He is SHIELD AGENT COULSON. He stares down at the object which glows with an otherworldly blue energy -- MJOLNIR. He pulls out a phone.
[COULSON 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 51A. In a back room, Thor, now shirtless and wearing jeans, looks around for a t-shirt. Jane and Darcy, standing in the lab, can't help but notice his reflection in the mirror. Darcy eyes his powerful build, rippling biceps.]
Darcy Lewis: You know, for a crazy homeless guy, he's pretty cut. Jane turns away. Thor emerges from the back room, holding a t-shirt.
Darcy Lewis: Hey, sorry I tased you! Thor heads over to Jane's work area, starts fiddling with the equipment there with interest. Jane hurries over to put a stop to it.
Jane Foster: Excuse me... excuse me! She leads him away from the work station. Thor holds up the t-shirt. On the front, it bear a sticker which reads: "HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. DONALD BLAKE". Thor looks at it, puzzled. Jane rips the sticker off.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 52.]
Jane Foster: My ex. Thor stares at her a beat.
Jane Foster: They're the only clothes I had that'll fit you. Sorry.
Thor: They will suffice. Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on the wall.
Jane Foster: You're welcome. Now tell me... Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to his form in the Bifrost photo.
Jane Foster: What were you doing, in that? He glances at it, dismissive.
Thor: What does anyone do in the Bifrost? Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word. Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within the book, curious.
Dr. Erik Selvig:  The Bifrost... Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close to her, looking over her notations. She quickly closes the book.
Jane Foster: What exactly is the Bifrost?
[THOR JANE BUT-- 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 52A.]
Jane Foster: Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.
[Frigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand. Odin lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep. The walls of the chamber have moved close around him, protecting him like a dark crypt, sealing off any daylight. Loki sits at Odin's side, across from Frigga. She speaks softly to him.]
Frigga: I asked him to be honest with you from the beginning. There should be no secrets in a family.
Loki: So why did he lie?
Frigga: He kept the truth from you so that you would never feel different. You are in every way our son, Loki, and we your family. You must know that. Loki takes this in, stares at Odin.
[FRIGGA (CONT'D)]
Loki: How long will it last?
Frigga: I don't know. This time is different. We were unprepared.
Loki: I never get used to seeing him like this. The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored.
Frigga: But he's put it off for so long now, I fear... Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her eyes.
Frigga: You're a good son. Loki sits there, uncertain how to react, uncertain how he really feels.
Frigga: We mustn't lose hope that your father will return to us. And your brother. Loki looks to Frigga, concerned.
Loki: What hope is there for Thor?
Frigga: There's always a purpose to everything your father does. Thor may yet find a way home. Loki looks troubled by the revelation. He rises, heads for the exit, when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS hurriedly approaching.
Frigga: Thor is banished. The line of succession falls to you. Until he awakens, Asgard is yours.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53A. The Einherjar kneel before the shocked Loki. Another EINHERJAR enters, holding Gungnir before him. He kneels before Loki, offers the spear to him.]
Frigga: Make your father proud. Loki reaches out tentatively, then takes it. He likes the feel of it in his hand.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 54. Thor, Selvig, Darcy, and Jane sit at a table in the local diner. Selvig and Darcy watch as Thor eats ravenously from a huge mound of steak and eggs. A couple other full plates -- pancakes and biscuits and gravy -- are piled high before him. Jane's eager, her notebook at the ready.]
Jane Foster: Now tell us exactly what happened to you last night. Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets flustered, looks away.
Jane Foster: Maybe start with how you got inside that cloud.
Darcy Lewis: And how you could eat an entire box of Pop-Tarts and still be this hungry. Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of coffee.
Thor:  This drink. I like it.
Darcy Lewis:  Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Isabela makes the best coffee in town. Thor hurls the empty mug at the ground, SHATTERING it.
[THOR]
Jane Foster: Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 54A. ISABELA]
Jane Foster:  What was that? He doesn't understand. The other patrons stare at him.
Thor: It was delicious. I want another.
Jane Foster: Then you should just say so!
Thor: I just did.
Jane Foster: I mean ask for it. Nicely.
Thor: I meant no disrespect.
Jane Foster: All right, then no more smashing, deal?
Thor: You have my word.
Jane Foster: Good.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55. A few TOWNIES, looking bedraggled, enter and take a seat at the counter. We recognize them from the crater. (Among them is the Drunk Townie Jake, who is not presently drunk.)]
Isabela: Morning, Pete. Jake.
TOWNIE PETE: The usual, please, Izzy. Isabela pours them a couple cups of coffee.
Isabela: What crater? Jane and Selvig overhear this, exchange a look, turn to the Townies with interest.
TOWNIE PETE: They're saying some kind of satellite crashed in the desert.
Jane Foster:  Excuse me, did you say there was a satellite crash?
Darcy Lewis: Oh my God, this is going on Facebook. Darcy whips out her cellphone.
[DARCY (CONT'D) 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55A. Thor looks puzzled as she SNAPS a photo of him and his massive stack of food.]
Dr. Erik Selvig:  What did the satellite look like?
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 56. Thor springs to his feet, heads over to Drunk Townie Jake, and pulls the Townie around to face him.]
Thor: Where?!
PETE: I wouldn't bother! Looked like the whole Army was coming in when we left!
[Thor studies the position of the sun, gauging his bearings. Jane, Darcy, and Selvig catch up to him.]
Jane Foster: Where are you going?
Thor: Twelve miles east of here. He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks with him.
Jane Foster: Why?
Thor: To get what belongs to me.
Jane Foster: So now you own a satellite?
Thor: It's not what they say it is.
Jane Foster: Whatever it is, the government seems to think it's theirs. You intend to just walk in there and take it?
Thor: Yes. He stops walking.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 57.]
Thor: If you take me there now, I'll tell you everything you wish to know.
Jane Foster: Everything?
Thor: All the answers you seek will be yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir. Darcy looks to the others.
Darcy Lewis: "Myeu-muh?" What's "Myeu-muh?" Jane studies Thor. He looks sincere. She's nearly swayed,
[WHEN:]
Dr. Erik Selvig: Jane. He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much care for him.
[SELVIG (CONT'D)]
Jane Foster: You know what we saw last night. This can't be a coincidence. I want to know what's in that crater.
Dr. Erik Selvig: I'm not talking about the crater. I'm talking about him.
Jane Foster: He's promised us answers.
Dr. Erik Selvig: He's delusional! Listen to what he's saying! "Thor." "Bifrost." "Mjolnir." These are the stories I grew up with as a child!
Jane Foster: I'd just be driving him out there, that's all.
Dr. Erik Selvig: It's dangerous. He's dangerous.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 58. After a moment, she nods. They head back over to Thor and Darcy.]
Jane Foster: I'm sorry. I can't take you.
Thor: I understand. Then this is where we say goodbye. He takes her hand and kisses it.
Jane Foster: That's... thank you. Thor bows slightly to each of them.
Thor: Jane Foster... Erik Selvig... Darcy. Farewell. He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Now... let's get back to the lab. We have work to do. Selvig and Darcy turn and start to go. Jane looks after Thor as he walks away down the street.
[Sif joins the Warriors Three as they hurry towards the Throne Room. Two EINHERJAR GUARDS enter, admitting Sif and the Warriors Three, who burst through the entrance, heads bowed. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 59.]
Sif: Allfather, we must speak with you
[But as they raise their heads, they stop short to see]
[Loki is sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand. Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them.]
Volstagg: What is this?
Loki: My friends... you haven't heard? I am now Ruler of Asgard.
Fandral: Where is Odin?
Loki: Father's fallen into the Odinsleep. My mother fears he may never awaken again.
Sif: We would speak with her. Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a look. Loki notices.
Loki: She has refused to leave my father's bedside. You can bring your "urgent" matter to me, your King. Sif covers quickly.
Sif: We would ask you to end Thor's banishment.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60.]
Loki: My first command can not be to undo the Allfather's last. We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times. Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of this.
Loki: All of us must stand together, for the good of Asgard.
Fandral: Of course. Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit. Loki stares after them.
[Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head up the street. They're by Arturo's, when a PICK-UP TRUCK pulls up before them, stopped by traffic. In the back of the vehicle, Jane notices, partially covered by a tarp, the dark matter analysis machine from her lab.]
Jane Foster: Hey! That's my stuff!
[66A EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 66A Jane, Selvig, and Darcy reach the lab, where government vehicles are parked. SHIELD AGENTS haul equipment out of the lab and load it into waiting vans. Other Agents strip all the equipment from inside the Pinzgauer and cart it away. Still others emerge from her trailer, arms loaded with scientific instruments and documents.]
Jane Foster: What the hell is going on here?! The Agents ignore her as Agent Coulson approaches.
Agent Phil Coulson: Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson, with

Jane Foster: I don't care who you work for, you can't do this!
Dr. Erik Selvig: Jane. This is more serious than you realize. Let it go.
Jane Foster: Let it go?! This is my life!
Agent Phil Coulson: We're here investigating a security threat. We need to appropriate your equipment and all your atmospheric data.
Jane Foster: By "appropriate" you mean "steal?" Instead of answering, Coulson gives her a check.
Agent Phil Coulson: This should more than compensate you for your trouble. She throws the check to the ground without looking at it.
Jane Foster: I can't just pick up replacements from RadioShack! I made most of that equipment myself!
Agent Phil Coulson: Then I'm sure you can do it again.
Jane Foster: And I'm sure I can sue you for violating my constitutional rights!
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 61.]
Agent Phil Coulson: We're the good guys, Ms. Foster. He tries to walk away, but Jane blocks his path. She is fully herself, fueled by outrage.
Jane Foster: So are we! We're on the verge of
[Jane holds up her notebook.]
Jane Foster: Everything I know about this phenomenon is in this lab and in this book, and no one has the right to take it from me. 
[Coulson gestures to a nearby AGENT, who promptly plucks the notebook out of Jane's hands and adds it to the pile he's carrying. Jane is stunned.]
Agent Phil Coulson: Thank you for your cooperation. He gets into a car. The cars and trucks pull away.
[Jane, Selvig, and Darcy enter, staring in shock at the now- empty space.]
Jane Foster: Years of research, gone.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 62.]
Darcy Lewis: They even took my iPod.
Dr. Erik Selvig: And your back-ups?
Jane Foster: Look around! They took our back- ups. They took the back-ups of our back-ups.
Darcy Lewis: I just downloaded, like, thirty songs on there.
[JANE]
Dr. Erik Selvig: No one knows much about them. But I knew a scientist -- a pioneer in gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up, and he was never heard from again.
Jane Foster: I'm not going to let them do this. I'm getting everything back.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Please, let me contact one of my colleagues. Dr. Pym has had some dealings with these people. I'll e- mail him and see if he can help.
Darcy Lewis: They took your laptop, too. Annoyed, Selvig thinks.
[67A EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO LIBRARY - DAY 67A Selvig and Jane in the Pinzgauer drive up in front of the town's rinky-dink library. A sign in the window reads, "FREE INTERNET."]
Dr. Erik Selvig: I'll just be a minute. He climbs out and heads inside. Jane looks down the street and sees something that intrigues her.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 62A. Thor enters the store and approaches a PET STORE CLERK.]
Thor: I need a horse.
Thor: Then give me one of those, large enough to ride. The Pet Store Clerk looks confused. Just then, Thor hears a CAR HORN. He turns to the open door. Across the street, Jane calls to him from the Pinzgauer.

Librarian: Joshua, come sit down. It's story time. The Kid closes his book and joins the others. Selvig looks over, notices the title of the book the Kid was reading --

[It's a picture of a RAINBOW BRIDGE coming down from Asgard to earth. ASGARDIANS walk upon it, among them ODIN, LOKI, and THOR, who wields Mjolnir. On the ground below them, a group of VIKINGS kneel reverently. He eyes the illustration, pondering.]

Jane Foster: I've never done anything like this before! Have you ever done anything like this before? Thor looks amused by her excitement.
Thor: Many times. You're brave to do it.
Jane Foster: They just stole my entire life's work. I really don't have anything left to lose.
Thor: But you're clever. Far more clever than anyone else in this Realm.
Jane Foster: "This Realm?" Why do you talk like that?
Thor: You think me strange? Jane laughs, catches herself.
Jane Foster: Yeah. Just a little.
Thor: Good strange or bad strange?
Jane Foster: I'm not quite sure yet. She looks at him, sees him staring at her. She's lost in his gaze, distracted, when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She quickly turns her eyes forward, regains control of the car.
Jane Foster: Sorry. She glances back at him. He's confident, determined.
Jane Foster: Who are you? Really?
Thor: You'll see soon enough.
Jane Foster: You promised me answers.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63B. Thor looks at her, charmed by her persistence.]
Thor: What you seek -- it's a bridge.
Jane Foster: A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?
Thor: More like a rainbow bridge.

Jane Foster: God, I hope you're not crazy.
[71A EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 71A As the Pinzgauer heads away, we continue up a hillside, revealing a light illuminating the valley beyond. As we move closer, we see the glow comes from -- A MASSIVE SHIELD BASE Now set up around the crater -- vehicles, trailers, barricades. Armed GUARDS man a gate in the razor wire fence that runs fifty yards from the crater's edge, enclosing the]
complex.: Clear, plastic access tubes with junction boxes lead to a translucent cube structure erected in the middle of the crater. Through the glass walls of the base's command trailer, we see Coulson directing TECHNICIANS, busy at work. Within the cube structure itself, a team of SHIELD SCIENTISTS work with high-tech machinery, analyzing the object at the center of it all -- Mjolnir.
[Jane and Thor crawl to the edge of the ridge, look through binoculars, see the impressive SHIELD base.]
Jane Foster: That isn't a satellite crash. They would have hauled the wreckage away, not built a city around it. Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her.
Thor: You're going to need this.
Jane Foster: Why?-- Thunder RUMBLES overhead. She stares at him intently and takes his jacket.
Thor: Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I will return what they stole from you.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64A. He looks to her, already knowing that Jane may disobey his request.]
Thor: Deal?
Jane Foster: No! Look what's down there! You can't just walk in, grab our stuff, and walk out!
Thor: No. Jane looks relieved.
Thor: I'm going to fly out. Before she can react, he starts heading towards the crater. The first drops of rain begin to patter into the dust.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 65.]
Jane Foster: Wait... But Thor is already headed towards the crater.
[72A EXT. SHIELD BASE / INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE STRUCTURE 72A A NEEDLE spikes on a handheld SENSOR DEVICE. The TECHNICIAN holding it looks over at the hammer. Mjolnir begins to give off a subtle glow. A bolt of lightning CRACKS across the sky above. CUT TO: 73 AN AERIAL INFRARED VIDEO IMAGE OF THE AREA 73 It's fuzzy, doesn't show much.

TECHIE: Feed from the keyhole. Can barely penetrate the cloud cover. The Techie hikes a thumb at another monitor, SQUELCHING with static. It shows an SAR shot of the area, laid over a terrain map.
TECHIE: Tech's barely working as it is, with all the interference that thing's giving off. He gestures towards the hammer. He checks a computer.
TECHIE: Hey, we've got a commercial aircraft coming in right over us, Southwest Airlines Flight 5434.
Jasper Sitwell: Reroute it, like all the others.
TECHIE: Right. Can I get the passengers some free drinks for the trouble? Sitwell glares at him.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 65A. TECHIE (CONT'D)]
TECHIE: Hold a sec... we got something outside the fence, west side... He points at the screen. Through the haze, it shows a THERMAL IMAGE huddled beside the fence.
Jasper Sitwell:  DeLancey, Jackson -- check it out.
[74A EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 74A A pair of SHIELD AGENTS (DELANCEY and JACKSON) take off in a jeep to investigate. 74B EXT. SHIELD SECURITY ROOM 74B Sitwell looks out the window, something strange catching his attention. We see in the window's reflection that a glow is coming from the hammer containment area. The jeep pulls up as the Agents scan the fence with a flashlight, see nothing unusual. AGENT JACKSON 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 66. Before they can call it in, a massive CRACK OF LIGHTNING illuminates the night sky -- revealing the silhouette of a large man standing outside the driver's (Jackson's) side of the jeep. DeLancey looks over, notices.]
Agent Delancey: Jackson? The Agents reach for their weapons. Thor elbows the driver across the jaw, causing him to drop his weapon. Jackson slumps over the steering wheel, as DeLancey starts to raise a shotgun at Thor. Thor grabs the barrel, yanks it out of DeLancey's hands and thrusts the hilt back, smashing the Agent's jaw. Thor reaches into the jeep to grab a rain slicker.
[75A INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY 75A Sitwell talks into his radio, starting to look worried. SITWELL Thor, now wearing a SHIELD rain slicker, makes his way across]
[Another SHIELD AGENT approaches the jeep, spots the unconscious DeLancey and Jackson. He quickly calls into his radio.]
SHIELD AGENT: Agents down! We've got a perimeter breach!
[The security monitors SQUELCH with static and interference. Sitwell holds his PDA -- even it's on the fritz. Sitwell and the Techie watch the monitors warily. On the monitor showing the hammer containment area, Mjolnir starts to crackle with energy.]
Jasper Sitwell:  Get Coulson. Sitwell punches an alarm.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 66A. As Thor makes his way towards the crater, an alarm sounds and SECURITY LIGHTS explode to life. 78A EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 78A A spotlight fires out from the base and sweeps across the ridge towards Jane. She ducks down, out of sight. She pulls out her cellphone and dials. We hear Selvig's recorded message.]
Dr. Erik Selvig: You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig. Please leave me a message. His voicemail BEEPS. She talks quietly, urgently.
Jane Foster: Erik, okay, first of all, don't worry. I'm perfectly fine, really. More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base.
Jane Foster: But if you don't hear from me again, you might want to come out to the crater site and look for me. I kind of did what you said I shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye. She hangs up.
[Coulson emerges from the SHIELD command trailer and marches across the mud, radio to his ear. He looks out across the lit up site uneasily. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67. A SHIELD GUARD moves through the base, rifle in hand. From the shadows behind a trailer, a FIGURE looks out at him. As the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly rushes towards him and chokes him out. He falls to the]
[Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the fallen Guard. He stares down at the weapon quizzically. As more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by. Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main entrance tube to the center of the site. A bright light suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight right on him. Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact. He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing the ATV's spotlight. Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off the wheel to protect himself. The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube entrance. The Guards notice and chase after it. Thor emerges from the shadows, watches the Guards abandoning the site entrance.]

TUNNEL 82G As Thor races through the tunnel, a GUARD runs right at him, on a collision course. Thor takes him out with a punch to the gut, then turns to see more AGENTS coming towards him. Thor picks up the fallen Guard he punched, then throws him into the approaching Agents, scattering them. Thor turns around, runs back the way he came. The Agents give chase. 82H EXT.

Clint Barton / Hawkeye: Hello, handsome.
[83A INT. TUNNEL 83A Thor races through the tunnel, comes across a wall of AGENTS. Thor ROARS and barrels through them -- elbowing, punching -- whatever it takes to keep moving. As he takes down the last Agent, Thor sees the last junction box and the entrance to the cube structure up ahead. He races towards it. He can actually see Mjolnir within the middle of the structure, when -- BAM! From out of nowhere, a fist lands a powerful blow across his jaw, sending him reeling. Dazed, Thor looks up to see -- A HUGE SHIELD AGENT The biggest of them all, standing between him and his hammer in the cube structure beyond. Thor sizes him up.]
Thor: You're big. Thor grins.
Thor: Fought bigger.

Jane Foster: No...
[Thor and the Huge Agent struggle to stand in the mud. Through the translucent walls of the cube structure, Thor sees Mjolnir. The Huge Agent rises up before him, blocking]
his view.: Rain and blood run down Thor's face. He lunges forward, whipping his feet in front of him, then kicks out, nailing the Huge Agent in the chest. The Agent goes down hard as Thor's momentum carries him past. Thor stands, heads for the cube structure, when the Huge Guard grabs his ankle in a last effort. Thor looks back down at his foe, then drops backwards, pile driving his elbow into the fallen Agent's chest. The Huge Agent grimaces in pain, defeated. Thor races back towards the structure.

From overhead, we see the hammer in the cube containment room. We pull up as the Guards approach Thor, then continue to climb, until we see the whole camp -- and the extensive damage Thor's done to it during the melee.

[ She steels herself, then starts over the ridge to help him. Almost immediately, a SPOTLIGHT sweeps past her. She hears the sound of DOGS and SHIELD AGENTS approaching, sees the glow of flashlights moving from the base towards her. With no other choice, she makes a quick retreat.]
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 69A. Heimdall stands at his post, watching the scene. He lowers his head. Jane stands with Selvig and Darcy in the empty lab. Darcy picks up the book Selvig checked out of the library, looks through it.]
Jane Foster: I can't just leave him there.

Dr. Erik Selvig: Why not?
Jane Foster: You didn't see what happened. Darcy points at an illustration of Thor's hammer in the book.
Darcy Lewis: Hey! Myeu-muh! Jane looks at the illustration in the book, turns to Selvig knowingly.
Dr. Erik Selvig: In the children's section. I wanted to show you how ridiculous his story was. 
[Jane is unconvinced by this. She knows he wants to believe.]
Jane Foster: Aren't you the one who's always told me to chase down all leads, all possibilities?
Dr. Erik Selvig: I was talking about science, not magic!
Jane Foster: Magic's just science we don't understand yet. Arthur C. Clarke.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Who wrote science fiction.
Jane Foster: The precursor of science fact.
Dr. Erik Selvig: In some cases.
Jane Foster: If that's really an Einstein-Rosen Bridge out there, then there's something on the other side.

Dr. Erik Selvig: Jane...
Darcy Lewis: A primitive culture like the Vikings might have worshipped them as deities. They give her a look, surprised by her unexpectedly insightful input. Darcy shrugs. Jane points at her, grateful for the support.
Jane Foster: Yes! Exactly! Thank you! Darcy beams.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 71.]
Dr. Erik Selvig: Jane, if you do this, you'll find yourself in a situation that I won't be able to get you out of this time.
Darcy Lewis: I'll help you. Jane looks grateful. Selvig looks at her, sees there's no stopping her. He sighs.
[Thor sits in a chair, staring forward blankly, hands cuffed behind him. Coulson stands across from him.]
Agent Phil Coulson: It's not easy to do what you did. You made us all look like a bunch of mall cops. That's hurtful.
Agent Phil Coulson: Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan? Then again, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type. What was it, South Africa? Still no answer. Coulson leans in close to him.
Agent Phil Coulson: Certain groups pay well for a good mercenary. Especially HYDRA. Coulson waits for a response, but gets none.
Agent Phil Coulson: Who are you?
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 72.]
Thor: Just a man.
Agent Phil Coulson: One way or another, we find out what we want to know. We're good at that. Coulson leaves the room. Thor lowers his head.
Loki: I thought he'd never leave. Thor looks up, shocked to find Loki standing there, dressed in 21st century attire.
Thor: Loki? What are you doing here?
Loki: I had to see you.
Thor: What's happened? Tell me! Is it Jotunheim? Let me explain to
[FATHER--]
Loki: Father is dead. Thor stares at him, stunned.
Thor: What?
Loki: Your banishment, the threat of a new war, it was too much for him to bear. The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him, looks in his eyes, consolingly.
Loki: You mustn't blame yourself. I know that you loved him. I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen.

Loki: This is goodbye, brother. I'm so sorry.
Thor: No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you for coming here.
Loki: Nothing could have stopped me. Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki.
Loki: Fare well, brother.
Thor: Good-bye.
Agent Phil Coulson: Good-bye? I just got back. Thor looks up to see that Loki is gone.
Agent Phil Coulson: Now. Where did we leave off?
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 73A. Agents and Scientists work to repair the damaged area around Mjolnir. They take no notice of Loki as he steps up beside the hammer. He stares at it -- intrigued, wondering. Can he]
do it?: He reaches down, tries to lift it -- but can't. He lets it go, eyes it with contempt, then steps away. He gestures with his arms. An odd GREEN AND GOLD LIGHT rises from the ground, enveloping him, then he disappears.
[Sitwell enters and speaks sotto to Coulson. SITWELL 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74. Coulson and several other SHIELD AGENTS stand across from Erik Selvig.]
Agent Phil Coulson: "Donald Blake?"
Dr. Erik Selvig: Doctor Donald Blake. He's part of our team.
Agent Phil Coulson: You have dangerous coworkers, Dr. Selvig.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Troubled, not dangerous. He was distraught when he found out that you'd taken all of our research. It was years of his life, gone! He got depressed, started drinking, and... well, you know the rest.
Agent Phil Coulson: Uh-huh. You mind if we take a moment to verify his identity?
Dr. Erik Selvig: Certainly. The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name.
Dr. Erik Selvig: You can understand how a man could go off like that. I mean, a big, faceless organization like yours, coming in with their jack-booted thugs and stealing private property...
Agent Phil Coulson: That doesn't explain how he managed to tear through our security. Selvig shrugs.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness nut.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74A. On the Techie's monitor, a DMV record from the State of New York pops up reading "DR. DONALD BLAKE". The license photo is indeed a picture of Thor -- the one Darcy took with her cellphone. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75.

Agent Phil Coulson: It says here he's an M.D.
Dr. Erik Selvig: He is. That is, he was. He switched careers and became a physicist. He's quite brilliant, really.

Agent Phil Coulson: Just keep him away from the bars.
Dr. Erik Selvig: I will!

Darkness shrouds the ruined temple, save for the shafts of light which knife their way in through the damaged ceiling. Loki enters. Frost Giant guards surround him on all sides. Laufey approaches, towers over him menacingly.]
Laufey: Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.
Loki: I've come alone and unarmed.
Laufey: To what end?
Loki: To make you another proposition.
[LAUFEY]
Loki: You're welcome.
Laufey: My men are dead, and I have no Casket. You are a deceiver. Laufey lashes out, grabs Loki around the throat, but Loki calmly stands his ground.
Loki: You have no idea what I am. The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the guards stare in shock. Loki grins.
Loki: Hello, Father. Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal. Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76A.]
Laufey: Ah, the bastard son. I thought Odin had killed you. That's what I would have done. He's as weak as you are.
Loki: No longer weak. I now rule Asgard, until Odin awakens. Perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me. This gives Laufey pause.
Laufey: Or perhaps it was the wisest choice I've ever made. I will hear you.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 77.]
Loki: I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into his chambers, and let you slay him where he lies. I'll keep the throne, and you will have the Casket. Laufey studies Loki's face.
Laufey: Why would you do this?
Loki: When all is done, we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds. Then I, the bastard son, will have accomplished what Odin and Thor never could.
Laufey: This is a great day for Jotunheim. Asgard is finally ours.
Loki: No. Asgard is mine. The rest of the Nine Realms will be yours, if you do as you're told. Laufey considers the proposition.
Laufey: I accept. Loki turns to leave. As he goes, the slightest trace of a smile crosses his face.
[Loki emerges out of the Bifrost, as Heimdall steps away from his controls. Heimdall glares at Loki. Loki notices.]
Loki: What troubles you, Gatekeeper?
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78.]
Heimdall: I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim, but could neither see nor hear you. You were shrouded from me, like the Frost Giants who entered this Realm.
Loki: Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.
Heimdall: Or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see. Loki sizes him up, smiles.
Loki: You have great power, Heimdall. Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?
Heimdall: No.
Loki: And why is that?
Heimdall: Because he is my King, and I am sworn to obey him.
Loki: Exactly. Just as you're sworn to obey me now. Yes? A beat.
Heimdall: Yes.
Loki: Good. Then you will open the Bifrost to no one until I have undone what my brother has started. Loki heads out of the Observatory. Heimdall stares after him.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78A. Thor and Selvig sit at a booth at the back of the local dive. The bartender sets down a couple mugs of beer and two shots of whiskey. Selvig pours the shot into his mug and downs it. Thor follows his example. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 79.]
Dr. Erik Selvig: Seems Darcy's a terrible intern, but a talented hacker.
Thor: Thank you for what you've done.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.
Thor: Are you in love with her?
Dr. Erik Selvig: Of course not! Jane's like a daughter to me. Her father and I taught at University together. A good man, but he never listened. This registers with Thor.
Thor: Neither did I. Selvig eyes him with interest.
Dr. Erik Selvig: I don't know if you're really delusional, and I really don't care at this point. I just care about her. I've seen the way she looks at you.
Thor: I swear to you, I mean her no harm.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Good. If that's the case, then I'll buy you one more drink, and you'll leave town tonight. A long pause, then Thor nods. He takes a drink.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80.]
Thor: I had it all backwards. I had it all wrong. Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than he's seen before.
Dr. Erik Selvig: It's not a bad thing, finding out that you don't have all the answers. That's when you start asking the right questions. Thor takes this in.
Thor: For the first time in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Anyone who's ever going to find their way in this world has to start by admitting they don't know where the hell they are. Thor nods.
DRUNK TOWNIE: Hey, I know you, man... An intimidating DRUNK TOWNIE nearby sizes up Thor. He is one of the Townies from Isabela's Diner who saw Thor earlier. He approaches, belligerent and looking for a fight.
DRUNK TOWNIE: You were in the diner with that hot girl. Thor doesn't like where this is going.
DRUNK TOWNIE: I wouldn't mind her doing a little research on me. He laughs. Thor is annoyed.
Thor: I have no quarrel with you. But she's a lady. You should be more respectful.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80A.]
DRUNK TOWNIE: And you should shut the hell up, princess. Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it. But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the Townie's baiting.
Thor: I will not fight him.
DRUNK TOWNIE: Then it'll be easy to kick your ass. Selvig stands, steps between the two men.
Dr. Erik Selvig: Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our heads. Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out. Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81. SELVIG (CONT'D) Thor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN FOLK SONG. They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically in time with the song. THOR/SELVIG The small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray, strewn with various books, old pizza boxes, etc. A worried Jane lies on her bed, trying to read. She's startled by the loud RAPPING on the door. She bolts to the door and opens it to find --]

Thor: Sorry, my friend.
Jane Foster: What happened?
Thor: We drank. We fought. He made his ancestors proud.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82.]
Jane Foster: Put him on the bed. Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes.
Dr. Erik Selvig: I still don't believe you're the God of Thunder.
Thor: These are your chambers? Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up the mess around her.
Jane Foster: Well, it's more of a temporary living space, really. I don't usually have visitors in here. Actually, never... Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from him, puts it away.
Jane Foster: Can we go outside?
[Thor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors. He offers Jane his hand, helps her up. There's a telescope set up, a couple chairs, some blankets.]
Jane Foster: I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to reconcile particle data. Or when Darcy's driving me crazy.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82A.]
Jane Foster: I'm glad you're safe.
Thor: You've been very kind. I've been far less grateful than you deserve.
Jane Foster: I also hit you with my car a couple times, so it kind of evens out. He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her

Jane Foster: I don't believe it... She takes it from him, surprised and grateful.
Thor: It was all I could get back. Not as much as I promised. I'm sorry.
Jane Foster: No, this is good. Thank you. This means I don't have to start from scratch... She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a harsh realization clouding her face. Thor notices.
Thor: What's wrong?
Jane Foster: SHIELD, whatever they are. They're never going to let this research see the light of day.
Thor: You must do this. You must finish what you've started.
Jane Foster: Why?
Thor: Because you're right. It's taken so many generations for your people to get to this point. You're nearly there. You just need someone to show you how close you really are.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 83. Thor moves beside her, opens her notebook, turns to the page which bears a sketch of the Bifrost. He takes the pen from the notebook, begins to add to the sketch, leading from one point to another in space.]
Thor: Look -- your ancestors called it magic. You call it science. I come from a place where they're one and the same thing. We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil as she looks on, amazed and intrigued.
Jane Foster: What is it?
Thor: This is how my father explained it to me...
[Jane sleeps beside Thor on the blankets on the rooftop. He stares up at the night sky. She rolls close to him, nuzzles against him in her sleep. He looks down at her, beautiful in the moonlight, looks out at the town beyond her. Volstagg eats ravenously from a PLATTER OF FOOD. Sif stands nearby, ill at ease. Fandral watches Volstagg incredulously as the large warrior stuffs himself. Finally Fandral can stand it no more. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 84.]
Fandral: Our dearest friend banished, Loki on the throne, Asgard on the brink of war, yet you manage to consume four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef, and two casks of ale. Shame on you! Don't you care?! Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volstagg pulls his weapon, stopping him.
Volstagg: Do not mistake my appetite for apathy.
Sif: Stop it, both of you! We all know what we have to do, we're just too damned afraid to do it!
[HOGUN]
Fandral: It's treason, Hogun.
Volstagg: To hell with treason, it's suicide.
Fandral: Yes, yes, we know!
Sif: Thor would do the same for us. An EINHERJAR GUARD enters. They tense.
EINHERJAR GUARD: Heimdall demands your presence. Volstagg quickly drains his flagon of ale.
Volstagg: We're doomed.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 84A. Dawn breaks over the quiet town of Puente Antiguo. Thor awakens, looks down to see Jane still sleeping, nuzzled against him. She opens her eyes, looks up at him and smiles. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 85. He stands, offers his hand, helps her to her feet. Thor helps Jane down off a ladder. A groggy, hungover Selvig emerges from Jane's trailer. He sees Thor with Jane. Selvig eyes the two of them together, then:]
Dr. Erik Selvig: I need some coffee. The three head inside Smith Motors.
[FROM THE LIBRARY ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET SHIELD Agents Garrett and Cale watch the scene, pointing a small audio surveillance device towards the lab. 105A INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 105A Darcy and Selvig sit at a card table, drinking coffee. Thor holds a couple plates as Jane makes eggs on a hotplate. She scoops them out onto the plates. Thor takes them over to the table, sets them down before Selvig and Darcy.]
Darcy Lewis: Thanks.
Thor: You're very welcome. Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates. She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their breakfast, looking like a little family.
[106 OMITTED 106 107 OMITTED 107 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86. On a roof across the street from Smith Motors, Agents Garrett and Cale continue their surveillance, bored out of their wits. Agent Cale watches the group through the lab window with binoculars. Agent Garrett listens to his comm-link, turns to Cale.]
Agent Garrett: They want an update.
Agent Cale: Tell them he's eating eggs.
Agent Garrett: Scrambled or fried? Cale glares at him.
[AGENT CALE 108AA INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 108AA As the group finishes breakfast, Thor looks at the mug in his hand, gets an idea. THOR]
Darcy Lewis: Sure.
Thor: Thank you. Excuse me a moment. Thor leaves.
[108A EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER 108A In front of her diner, Isabela prepares to open for the day. (Through the window of Isabela's, we see chairs still atop tables.) Isabela sweeps the front porch. She looks up to see Thor approaching. She eyes him suspiciously. He offers her a MUG.]
Thor: To replace the one I broke. Please forgive my behavior.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86A. She takes it, looks at it curiously, then smiles at him.]
Isabel: Okay. Thank you.
Thor: If I may, I'd like to come back for more of your "coffee."
Isabel: Any time. He nods and walks away. 
[She stares after him, smiling, and shrugs.]
Isabel: She could do worse.
[Sif and the Warriors Three enter warily to find the intimidating Heimdall standing before the Observatory's controls. He glares at them accusingly.]
Volstagg: Good Heimdall, less us explain--
Heimdall: You would defy the commands of Loki our King, break every oath you have taken as warriors, and commit treason to bring Thor back? The four exchange nervous glances.
Sif: Yes, but--
Heimdall: Good. The group looks puzzled. What did he just say?
Volstagg: So you'll help us?
Heimdall: I am bound by honor to our King. I cannot open the Bifrost to you. With that, Heimdall leaves them alone in the Observatory. The others exchange puzzled looks.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86B.]
Fandral: Complicated fellow, isn't he?
Volstagg: Now what do we do? Sif glances at the control panel, notices something.
Sif: Look! The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the control panel. They exchange a grin. They have an ally. Sif hits the controls, and the Bifrost apparatus fires up.
[Coulson races in as a SHIELD TECHIE calls up satellite footage of the Bifrost storm on a monitor.]
Agent Phil Coulson: What the hell was that?
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 87.]
TECHIE: I don't know, sir. We got massive energy readings out of nowhere, then they just disappeared. Fifteen miles due northwest.
Agent Phil Coulson: Let's go take a look.
[Amidst the fury of the Bifrost storm, the Warriors Three and Sif drop to the ground in the New Mexico desert. They clamber to their feet as the Bifrost quickly recedes, the hole in the sky closing up behind it. The Bifrost runes cover the desert sand around them.]
Volstagg: He must have landed nearby. It's time to put our tracking skills to work. Spread out. Check the sand for indentations of his boot prints.
Fandral: The winds would have blown them away by now. We should look for signs of a campfire.
Sif: Or we could just start there. She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the distance -- the only visible sign of civilization -- and to Hogun, who has already started walking towards it. Volstagg and Fandral trade looks, their egos bruised.
Fandral: It's worth a look, I suppose. The party tromps towards the town.
[Townsfolk stare in wonder at the Warriors Three and Sif, as they stroll down the street in all their Asgardian splendor. A BOY Hits a baseball, which rolls under a parked car. He runs to retrieve it, but can't reach it. Suddenly, the side of the CAR rises into the air. The boy looks over, his mouth dropping open at what he sees. Volstagg easily holds the car up with one hand. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 88. Volstagg picks up the boy's ball, then drops the car. He hands the ball back to the boy, tousling his hair.]
Volstagg: There you go, lad! The boy just stares, standing frozen. The Asgardians head off.
Volstagg: Is it just me, or does Earth look a little different to you?
Sif: It has been a thousand years...
Volstagg: Things change so fast here. You leave for a millennium, and it's like the whole neighborhood's gone. Volstagg sniffs, smells something.
Volstagg: Perhaps we should split up.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 89. Agents Cale and Garrett spot Sif, Fandral, and Hogun walking down the street.]
AGENT GARRETT: Is there a Renaissance Faire in town?
AGENT CALE: Call it in. But before they can, Volstagg rises up behind them, smashes their heads together. They're out.
Volstagg: Never cared for spies. He starts to go, then sees their bag of fast food on the ground. Intrigued, he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a bite. He likes what he tastes.
Volstagg: Exquisite.
[Loki stands with Gungnir, surveying his kingdom, when an Einherjar Guard quickly approaches him, out of breath.]
EINHERJAR GUARD: My liege, the Warriors Three and the Lady Sif have gone missing. Loki reacts. He knows who's responsible.
[Loki approaches Heimdall on the Rainbow Bridge.]
Heimdall: Tell me, Loki, how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard?
Loki: You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of the Realm? There are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am King.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 90.]
Heimdall: Then I need no longer obey you. Heimdall raises his massive sword, strides towards Loki. Loki reaches out and, with both hands, takes hold of something invisible, hovering in mid-air before him. As it quickly fades into view, we realize what it is --
[THE CASKET OF ANCIENT WINTERS. The blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms, as Loki opens the Casket towards Heimdall, who is fast approaching. From inside the Casket, all hell breaks loose. The fury of the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried. Heimdall is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his massive sword at the prince. But the blade STOPS, frozen, just inches from Loki's throat. Loki breathes a sigh of relief and steps past him. Loki inserts Gungnir into the Observatory's control panel and opens the Bifrost. He gestures, and the veiled DESTROYER appears before him, a fiery glow rising within it. It turns its head toward its King.]
Loki: Ensure my brother does not return.
[Jane, Thor, Darcy, and Selvig make a charming team, tidying up after breakfast -- washing, drying, and putting plates and]
utensils away.: The door opens.
Volstagg: Found you! Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy turn to see --
[SIF AND THE WARRIORS THREE Staring baffled at the sight of the domestic Thor drying dishes in mortal clothing. Jane drops a plate. It goes SHATTERING on the floor. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 90A.]
Thor: My friends! Thor happily races over and greets his comrades. Jane, Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the room. Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with wonder.
Dr. Erik Selvig: I don't believe it...
Darcy Lewis: Who are they?
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 91.]
Volstagg: Lady Sif and the Warriors Three. Surely you've heard tales of Hogun the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and I, Volstagg the Svelte? Selvig looks pointedly at Volstagg's massive gut.
Volstagg: Well, perhaps I've put on a little more muscle since I was here last.
Jane Foster: That would have been a thousand years ago? Northern Europe?
Volstagg: Exactly! Those lovely herring people. They worshipped us! Thor grins, lays a hand on Volstagg's shoulder.
Thor: My friends, I've never been happier to see anyone. But you should not have come.
Fandral: We're here to take you home. Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving.
Thor: You know I can't. My father is dead because of me. I must remain in exile. The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.
Sif: Thor... your father still lives. Thor reacts to the revelation.
[A few SHIELD vehicles are parked by the Bifrost site. A few SHIELD agents stand nearby as SCIENTISTS take readings. Coulson kneels, examines the Bifrost Runes. He turns to an Agent. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 92.]
Agent Phil Coulson: Get somebody from Linguistics out here. Just then, they hear a RUMBLING overhead, as the Bifrost storm ROARS in the sky above. Coulson and the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, their vehicle windshields SHATTERING, as the Bifrost storm grows in strength. Finally, the hole in the sky overhead opens, and the funnel cloud EXPLODES out of it, touching down onto the desert floor. Coulson and the Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom.
[120 OMITTED MERGED WITH SCENE 119 120 Thor and the others see the Bifrost storm forming in the distance.]
Darcy Lewis: Was somebody else coming? Just then, the Bifrost funnel EXPLODES down to the ground.
[From behind a jeep, Coulson and the SHIELD AGENTS stare at the Destroyer in awe. We don't see it, just its shadow as it moves towards them. SHIELD AGENT]
Agent Phil Coulson: I don't think so. But the guy doesn't tell me anything.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 93. Coulson grabs a megaphone, steps forward, calls out to the Destroyer.]
Agent Phil Coulson: Hello! You're using unregistered weapons technology. Please identify yourself. We hear the HUM of the Destroyer's fiery energy power up inside.
Agent Phil Coulson: Incoming! As the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, a blast of energy from the Destroyer EXPLODES a vehicle. SHIELD agents return fire.
[Townspeople fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in the distance. Thor and the Asgardians prepare for battle, as Thor turns to Jane.]
Thor: Leave this town now. Get yourself and your friends to safety.
Jane Foster: What about you?
Thor: I must stay and fight. The Asgardians look to Thor.
Thor: I'm still a warrior, and I will fight by your side.
Volstagg: You're but a mortal now. You'll get yourself killed!
Fandral: Or one of us, trying to protect you.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 94.]
Sif: The best thing you can do is get the mortals to safety and leave the battle to us. Thor looks at the townsfolk around them, all oblivious to the oncoming threat.
[THOR]
Thor: Help me clear the streets. I'll let none of these people die this day. Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of Townsfolk off the streets, as the Warriors Three and Sif head across town, towards the Destroyer.
[124 OMITTED 124 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 95. Laufey and two Frost Giants appear out of the Bifrost and step onto the platform. Loki is waiting for them. He pulls Gungnir from the Observatory's control panel. The giant apparatus slows to a stop.]
Loki: Father. Welcome to Asgard.
[125A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 125A The site looks like the aftermath of a war zone. The smoldering wreckage of SHIELD vehicles lies strewn about. Thor, Jane, and Selvig clear the streets, loading confused TOWNSFOLK into cars, moving others indoors. A dog makes it way down the street, barking at something in front of it. Then we see it --]
[THE DESTROYER. Strides down the street, a red, fiery energy glowing from within it. It unleashes BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame.]
[128 OMITTED 128 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 96. Sif and the Warriors Three head down the street towards the Destroyer.]
Sif: Keep him distracted. She hurries off. The Warriors Three continue towards the behemoth.
Fandral: What do you think? "The Svartalfheim Twist?" "Kiss of the Hag?" "Face Full of Boot?" Volstagg grins eagerly.
Volstagg: "The Flying Mountain." Hogun and Fandral groan.
Fandral: Not "The Flying Mountain!" It threw out my back for a year last time!
Volstagg: Trust me, it'll work.
[Thor looks anxiously back down the street, where the Warriors Three get into position before the Destroyer. THOR FANDRAL 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 96A. Volstagg takes off running at full speed. As he catches up to his comrades, Hogun and Fandral grab him on either side, and with all their Asgardian might, hurl the voluminous warrior into the air at the black metal behemoth.]
Volstagg: For Asgaaaaard!!!
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 97. The Destroyer is unable to react quickly enough, as Volstagg SMASHES into the creature. It looks like it might actually work for a moment, but the Destroyer stays on its feet. It lifts Volstagg into the by the scruff of his neck. He shrugs]
[The Destroyer savagely HURLS him at Hogun and Fandral, smashing into them, when Sif Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her two-headed spear and plunges it deep into the back of the creature. The creature stands there motionless, the fire dimming in its faceplate, Sif standing atop its back. The Asgardians have a brief moment of hope. But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once again. Sif looks on with growing trepidation. Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 180 degrees to face its attackers. The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor. Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer unleashes another blast, sending Sif and her comrades flying in all directions. Hogun's POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks free, landing in the middle of the street.]
[Thor sees his friends lying injured on the ground, but has no time to act, as the Destroyer fires in his direction. A storefront near Smith Motor EXPLODES, knocking Thor, Jane, and Selvig off their feet. Thor helps Jane to her feet, when they notice Selvig lying on his back amidst the debris, impaled by a twisted piece of iron.]
Jane Foster: Erik! She and Thor hurry to his side. He's losing blood, going into shock.
[SELVIG 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98. Jane takes his hand as Thor spots Hogun's pouch of healing stones lying in the middle of the street. He makes a break for it, dodging through the flaming wreckage, then grabs the pouch and races back. He opens the pouch to find the fragile stones crushed and useless. He pours the contents out in his hand.]
Thor: Come on... give me one! Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over the end of the iron rod.
Jane Foster: What are you doing? What is that? As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it. Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound completely. Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed flesh.
Dr. Erik Selvig:  I'm really starting to like him. Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.
[Thor reaches Sif, who lies dazed, battered, and bloodied on the ground. He pulls her behind a burning vehicle.]
Thor: Go, while you can!
Sif: But the others...
Thor: You can't help them now. Your job is to survive. She struggles to sit up.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98A.]
Sif: No! I will die a warrior's death. Stories will be told of this day-- He gently takes her shield from her.
Thor: Live and tell those stories yourself. At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious, with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way towards them. Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun and Fandral.
[THOR (CONT'D)]
Fandral: No. We can still fight!
Thor: But not win. Move Volstagg, or he'll die! Thor looks at them, grins.
Thor: Don't worry, my friends. I have a plan. The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and drag him away from the battlefield. After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then tosses Sif's shield aside. He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely defenseless.
Thor: Brother... for whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this, I am sorry. But these people have done nothing to you. They are innocents. He continues towards the Destroyer.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98B.]
Thor: Take my life, and know I will never return to Asgard.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 99. Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms. The Destroyer hesitates, sizing up the defenseless Thor, then swats him with its enormous arm. We hear the sickening CRACK of breaking bones as Thor goes flying. Thor lands in a crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith Motors, before Jane, Selvig, and Darcy. The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly from down the street, a look of horror on their faces. Jane tries to rush out to Thor's aid, but Selvig holds her back.]
Dr. Erik Selvig: Jane, no! He pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead, watching the scene --
[Odin lies in the Odinsleep. A single tear rolls down the Allfather's cheek. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 100. Thor's eyes close, his last breath leaving his lips. The Destroyer stands over Thor's body, lowers its head towards him. It opens its faceplate, locks it in place, readying to unleash its fiery blast. Inside the crater, the RUNES of the side of Mjolnir reappear, burning bright. Electricity starts to CRACKLE on the hammer's surface. SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead. They look up. Clouds form in the sky above. Just then, with a CRACK and flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies straight up into the air like a rocket. The Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when --]
[A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding with the Destroyer's blast. The explosion is massive. The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust enveloping the street. As the smoke clears we see --]
Jane Foster: Oh. My. God.
[Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale force winds. Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight.]
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 101. It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate, locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor dives downwards straight at it, with Mjolnir before him. Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast, overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the]
[Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate. The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES within him, firing out of all his openings. Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever. Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and debris pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the skies, around the Destroyer, burying it. Jane and Thor's comrades, now roused, stand to join him. A battered Coulson approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS.]
Agent Phil Coulson: Donald... I don't think you've been completely honest with me.
[Thor, Jane, Darcy, Selvig and the other Asgardians stand in the desert with Thor, Coulson, and several SHIELD AGENTS. Darcy turns to Volstagg.]
Darcy Lewis: So, how can you speak our language?
Volstagg: Your language? Ha! Silly girl, you're speaking ours. Thor calls up to the sky.
Thor: Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!
[Heimdall stands frozen. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102. Thor looks to the others with concern.]
Thor: He would open it if he could. I fear the worst.
Volstagg: Then we're trapped here forever.
Fandral: Then I suppose we'd best start settling into our new lives. He looks to Darcy, turns on the charm.
Fandral: Are all earth maidens as fair as you? Darcy enjoys the attention.
Darcy Lewis: No. Thor shouts back up to the sky.
Thor: Heimdall!
[From inside the ice, Heimdall hears Thor calling to him. Knowing that the fate of Asgard depends on him, he musters all his strength. The ice around him begins to CRACK. With a tremendous effort, Heimdall SHATTERS free from the ice. Weakened, near death, he drags himself inside the Observatory. The Asgardians begin to lose hope. Volstagg eyes a SHIELD Agent's machine gun.]
Volstagg: Primitive. Good enough for hunting small game, I suppose. Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky. Thor grins. The mortals look on, amazed. Fandral turns to Darcy.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102A.]
Fandral: Sorry, my love. These things happen.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 103. He joins the other Asgardians at their side. Thor turns to Coulson.]
Thor: Know this, son of Coul. You and I, we fight for the same cause -- the protection of this world. From this day forward, count me as your ally.
Agent Phil Coulson: Not stolen. Borrowed. Jane shoots him a look. Coulson quickly continues.
Agent Phil Coulson: You'll get your equipment back. You're going to need it to continue your research... which, after today's events, SHIELD would like to fully sponsor. If that's all right with you. Thor takes Jane's hand, kisses it tenderly. She looks at him, her eyes filled with the fear that she may never see him again.
Thor: Whatever fate lies before me, you are part of it. He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. Thor and the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost.
[The Asgardians emerge from the Bifrost to find Heimdall slumped over his controls.]
Thor:  Get him to the healing room! Leave my brother to me.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104. Thor bolts out the door. Odin lies in the Odinsleep, Frigga at his bedside. She hears the SHOUTS of Guards outside, the sound of a battle. Frigga Thor rides the winds over the Bridge, speeding towards the palace. The Jotun king stands over the unconscious Odin, relishing]
the moment.: He forms an ICE BLADE.
[Thor races through the entrance to the palace. Laufey stands before the sleeping Odin.]
Laufey: It's said you can still see and hear what transpires around you, even in this state. I hope it's true, so that you may know your death came by the hand of Laufey. He raises his blade above Odin's body, when --
[A BLAST OF ENERGY Hits him from behind. As the Jotun king falls to the ground, we see it is not Thor standing behind him, but Loki, holding Gungnir.]
Loki: And your death came by the son of Odin.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104A. Laufey dies as the other two shocked Frost Giants move for Loki. He fires Gungnir at one, blasting him against a wall, taking him out. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 105. The Brute is nearly upon him, when the Jotun stops suddenly, his eyes going wide. The Brute falls to the ground, REVEALING --]
Frigga: Standing behind him -- the sword stuck in his back. She looks to Loki, takes him in her arms.
Loki: I swear to you, mother, they will pay for what they've done today. I will end the Jotun threat, now and forever! He looks to Odin.
Loki: And I will make you proud. Loki savors the moment, but it's short-lived, as Thor bursts in. He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and respect. Stunned and delighted to see Thor, Frigga beams.
Frigga: Thor! She moves to Thor and hugs him, but Thor's eyes remain fixed on his brother. Loki looks at Mjolnir in his brother's hand.
Loki: Found its way back to you, did it?
Thor: No thanks to you. Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.
Frigga: What?
Thor: Why don't you tell her? How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends? To kill me? Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused.
Loki: It must have been enforcing Father's last command.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106.]
Thor: You're a talented liar, brother. Always have been.
[LOKI Thor flies from the blast through ANOTHER wall on the opposite side of the corridor, to... Thor plummets from the palace and CRASHES into the reflecting pools below. Loki speeds on horseback down the Rainbow Bridge, then quickly dismounts and enters the Observatory. Loki operates the Observatory's controls. The massive turret spins, points. Thor awakens to the sound of the Bifrost. He stands, sees the Observatory firing the Bifrost energy into space. He looks to where the Bifrost is aimed.]
Thor: Jotunheim...
[Thor soars on the winds above the Rainbow Bridge, the Bifrost energy roaring through Bridge, feeding into the Observatory. He lands before the Observatory's huge doorway. Thor enters, shields his eyes from the brilliant light of the Bifrost energy blasting towards Jotunheim. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106A. He looks over to the controls, sees that they're frozen in an enormous block of ice. Loki stands atop it.]
Loki: All these years, and no one's ever dared to use it as a weapon. Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor, blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the ice as Thor staggers to his feet.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 107.]
Loki: You can't stop it. The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart.
Thor: Why have you done this?
Loki: To do what Father never could. To destroy their kind forever. When he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of what I've done.
Thor: He won't! You can't kill an entire race!
Loki: What is this newfound love for the Frost Giants? You, who would have killed them all with your bare hands.
Thor: I've changed.
Loki: So have I. Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.
Loki: Fight me. He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow, but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back towards the frozen controls. Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which immobilizes Thor in the air. He hangs there, suspended.
Thor: Is the throne really worth what you've done? What you would become?
Loki: I never wanted the throne. I only wanted to be your equal. Now fight me!
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108. With a gesture of Gungnir, he flings Thor to the ground. Thor rises to his feet, turns to Loki.]
Thor: I will not fight you, brother.
Loki: I am not your brother. I never was.
Thor: Loki, this is madness... Loki grins.
Loki: Is it? He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to his feet.
Loki: What happened to you on earth that turned you so soft? Don't tell me it was a woman. Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right.
Loki: It was. Perhaps when we're finished here I'll pay her a little visit myself. That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing years of pent-up rage and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.
[It's mayhem. The growing Bifrost TEARS through the ice of the planet like a destructive wave, breaking it apart. JOTUNS go running in terror, others fall through the breaking ice. Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson look up with concern at the hole in the sky, where excess Bifrost energy builds up around it.]
Dr. Erik Selvig: Jane?
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108A.]
Jane Foster: Something's wrong.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 109. Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires Gungnir, sending Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his]
[The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim. Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too powerful. Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides towards the Bifrost.]
Loki: If you care so much for the Jotuns, then die with them. The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand towards the Bifrost. MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand. The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his brother.
[Thor and Loki come CRASHING through the Observatory dome and land hard, rolling across the Rainbow Bridge. As Thor gets to his feet, he sees Loki dangling off the Bridge's edge.]
Loki: Thor! Help me! Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking up at him desperately.
Loki: Please... Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir. Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls him across the bridge.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 110. Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees. Loki strides up behind him to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around. It passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next to him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion. Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one, never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.]
Loki: I was always more clever than you.
Thor: Yet still not clever enough. With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air, summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the Lokis. All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir knocked from his grasp. Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps away. Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's pinned to the ground. Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to do. Loki watches him smugly.
Loki: Look at you, the Mighty Thor. With all your strength, what good does it do you now? Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet, VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea. He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice. Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused.
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 111. Thor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him, thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he channels the power of the storm into it, then -- He strikes Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking the Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears where the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.]
Loki: Stop! What are you doing?! Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM! The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream out from it. Loki thinks fast.
Loki: If you destroy the Bridge, you'll never see her again! Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor through the back.
Thor: Forgive me. Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow -- KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING out of it. Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes. The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART. As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out from the broken Bridge. They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized by the debris, when --
[SEE -- 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 112.]
Odin: Standing on the edge of the broken Bridge, awakened from the Odinsleep, restored to his full strength. Loki searches his father's face, looking for some kind of approval, some kind of redemption, but all he sees is disappointment and regret. Loki lets go.
Thor: No! But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the Observatory, disappearing out of sight. Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back into his father's arms.
Odin: It is over.
[159 BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 159 The Bifrost energy explodes in the sky like fireworks firing]
Jane Foster: It's gone.
[A FEAST is in progress as Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three sit amongst the gathered Asgardians. Hogun sits between Fandral and Volstagg, who is in the middle of recounting their battle with the Destroyer.]
Volstagg: ...and then, with a mighty bellow, I flew at the great metal beast and laid it low...
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113.]
Fandral: Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge a--
Volstagg: As a matter of fact, falling down was a tactic. Lulling the Destroyer into a false sense of security!
Fandral: Well, I was the one who had to drag your enormous carcass off the battlefield. That makes me the real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun? Hogun points to Volstagg.
Hogun: Big stomach.  Big mouth. The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral look to Hogun. The grim warrior gives just a trace of a smile.
Fandral: Well, how about that? A smile! I'd say that calls for another drink! They laugh and raise another round. Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying the sadness she struggles to conceal. Sif notices, approaches Frigga, bows her head.
Sif: My Queen. I am so sorry for your loss. Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively.
Frigga: Thank you, Sif. She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment around him.
Frigga: How is he?
[4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113A.]
Sif: He mourns for his brother. And he misses her. The mortal. Frigga sees the trace of regret in Sif's face as she looks at Thor with new feelings. He rises and leaves the hall.
Frigga: He will need his friends now more than ever.
Sif: I will always be at his side. Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.
[Thor stands alone on the balcony, lost in thought. Odin walks up behind him.]
Odin: You'll be a wise King.
Thor: There will never be a wiser king than you. Or a better father.
Odin: You've already made me proud. Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words.
[Out of the broken, jagged Rainbow Bridge flows the Bifrost energy, drifting off into space. Thor walks out to its edge, where Heimdall stands watch. Thor stares out at the stellar void. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 114.]
Thor: Can you see her? Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.
Heimdall: Yes.
Thor: How is she?
[Through the window into Jane's lab, we see an enlarged ILLUSTRATION from her notebook pinned to a board. As we pull away, we see a computer terminal displaying a program clearly inspired by the illustration. We pull further back to see that the lab has been transformed into a well-funded research facility, abuzz with activity. SHIELD SCIENTISTS and AGENTS work with impressive, state-of-]
[Selvig orchestrates the process, giving instructions to the SCIENTISTS. We continue to track right outside the glass windows and rise up to find Jane sitting at the front of the roof, working at a small, improvised workstation, notebook at hand, as always. She sets up an impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE before her, which bears the "STARK INDUSTRIES" logo. From behind, Darcy approaches, hands her a flash drive.]
Darcy Lewis: Here you go.
Jane Foster: Thanks. Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.
Darcy Lewis: He would have come back if he could.
Jane Foster: I know. But if he can't get here on his own... Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a 3-D HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device, bathing the two women in its glow. We recognize what it is -- YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty.
Jane Foster: ...maybe we can help him find his way back.
