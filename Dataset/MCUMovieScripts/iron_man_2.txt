Tony (V.O.): Been a while since I was up here in front of you. Maybe I'll do us all a favour and just stick to the cards. There's been some speculation that I was somehow involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and on the rooftop
Christine Everhart (V.O.): Sorry, Mr Stark, do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that convinently appeared despite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards?
Tony (V.O.): Yes
MOSCOW
Christine (V.O.): And this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped with an undisclosed Stark high-tech powered battle 
Tony (V.O.): I know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.
Switch to view of a TV
Tony (on TV): I mean, let's face it, I'm not the heroric type. A laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public. The truth is  I am Iron Man.
Anton Vanko: Ivan. Vanya. That should be you.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: Don't listen to that crap
Anton Vanko: I'm sorry. All I can give you is my knowledge.
(Anton coughs and dies. Ivan is naturally distraught. Takes a swig of vodka. Pulls out blueprints for an arc reactor. Engineering montage as opening credits roll.)
*****
Man (V.O): 270 at 30 knots. Holding steady at 15000 feet. You are clear for exfiltration over the drop zone
(ACDC's Shoot to Thrill starts to play)
6 MONTHS LATER
(And a picture of Iron Man with an opening door in the bottom of an aeroplane. And he jumps out said aeroplane, landing on a stage. All very ostentatious. Dancing girls. Fireworks.)
STARK EXPO – FLUSHING, NEW YORK.
(Dismantling Iron Man suit.)
Pretty much everyone in the crowd: Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: It's good to be back. You missed me?
Man in crowd: Blow something up!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I missed you too. Blow something up? I already did that. I'm not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me. I'm not saying that from the ashes of captivity, never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history. I'm not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair, sipping on an iced tea because I haven't come across anyone who's man enough to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.
Woman in crowd: I love you Tony!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Please, it's not about me. [People still cheering Tony] It's not about you. It's not even about us. It's about legacy. It's about what we choose to leave behind for future generations. And that's why for the next year and for the first time since 1974, the best and brightest men and women of nations and corporations the world over will pool their resources, share their collective vision, to leave behind a brighter future. It's not about us. Therefore, what I'm saying, if I'm saying anything, is welcome back to the Stark Expo. [Big cheer from crowd.] And now, making a special guest appearance from the great beyond to tell you what it's all about, please welcome my father, Howard.
Howard Stark: Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust health, and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. So, from all of us here at Stark Industries, I would like to personally introduce you to the City of the Future. Technology holds infinite possibilities for mankind, [Tony is off the stage, doing something. Blood toxicity test. Gives a reading of 19%. Not good] and will one day rid society of all its ills. Soon technology will affect the way you live your life every day. No more tedious work, leaving more time for leisure activities and enjoying the sweet life. The Stark Expo. Welcome.
[Video ends. Cut to news feed of reporter outside.]
Reporter: We are coming to you live from the kickoff at the Stark Expo, where Tony Stark has just walked offstage. Don't worry if you can't make it down here tonight because this Expo goes on all year long. And I'm gonna be here checking out all the attractions and the pavilions and inventions from all around the world.
Happy Hogan: Make sure you join me 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: All right, it's a zoo out there, watch out.
Happy Hogan: Open up, let's go.
[Image is Tony trying to pass through the crowd, from Tony's perspective.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Hey, nice to see you. All right. Thank you. I remember you.
People: Tony, Tony
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Hey, hey.
Woman: Call me.
Happy Hogan: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [signing a picture of Iron Man] Hello. It would be a pleasure.
Happy Hogan: Okay
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [what would be ruffling the hair of a small boy if said small boy were not wearing an Iron Man helmet making hair unreachable] See you buddy
Happy Hogan: This is Larry.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you.
Larry: Call me. Call me.
Happy Hogan: Larry King.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Larry! Larry. Yes, my people, my people.
Happy Hogan: [Scene shows them finally at the door] Come on, Tony. There we go.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Very mellow.
Happy Hogan: That wasn't so bad.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: No, it was perfect.
Happy Hogan: Look what we got here, the new model.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Hey, does she come with the car?
Happy Hogan: I certainly hope so. Hi.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Hi. And you are?
Woman: Marshal.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Irish. I like it.
Marshal: Pleased to meet you Tony.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?
Marshal: Bedford.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: What are you doing here?
Marshal: Looking for you.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah? You found me. What are you up to later?
Marshal: Serving subpoenas. [Hands him a letter. Tony doesn't take it]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yikes.
Happy Hogan: [Reaching over and taking the letter] He doesn't like to be handed things.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah, I have a peeve.
Marshal: I got it. You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9 am.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Can I see a badge?
Marshal: You wanna see the badge?
Happy Hogan: He likes the badge.
Marshal: [showing him her badge.] You still like it?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yep. [Starts engine] How far are we from D.C.?
Happy Hogan: D.C.? 250 miles.
[Drive off. Image slides over, like when you used to make Powerpoints with all the transitions. It now shows Washing D.C. You can tell because words appear saying ]
WASHINGTON D.C.
Senator Stern: Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [turns around from where he was trying to talk to Pepper who looks like she was trying to tell him off.] Yes dear?
Senator Stern: Can I have your attention?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Absolutely.
Senator Stern: Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I do not.
Senator Stern: You do not?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon.
Senator Stern: The Iron Man weapon.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: My device does not fit that description.
Senator Stern: Well  How would you describe it?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.
Senator Stern: As?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: It's a high-tech prosthesis. That is  That is  That's actually the most apt description I can make of it.
Senator Stern: It's a weapon. It's a weapon, Mr Stark.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen 
Senator Stern: My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending or what state you're in. You can't have it.
Senator Stern: Look, I'm no expert 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: In prostitution? Of course not. You're a senator. Come on.
[People laugh. He waves. Pepper does not look impressed at all. He mouths "no?" and she shakes her head.]
Senator Stern: I'm no expert in weapons. We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons. I'd now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.
Justin Hammer: Absolutely. I'm no expert. I defer to you, Anthony. You're the wonder boy. Senator, if I may. I may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert? Your dad. Howard Stark. Really a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age. Let's just be clear, he was no flower child. He was a lion. We all know why we're here. In the last six months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities. And yet, he insists it's a shield. He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it. I wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do. I'd love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house, but this ain't Canada. You know, we live in a world of grave threats, threats that Mr Stark will not always be able to foresee. Thank you. God bless Iron Man. God bless America.
Senator Stern: That is well said Mr Hammer. The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Rhodey? What?
[Rhodey walks in, Tony gets up to greet him]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Hey, buddy. I didn't expect to see you here.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Look, it's me, I'm here. Deal with it. Let's move on.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I just 
James Rhodes / War Machine: Drop it.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: All right, I'll drop it.
Senator Stern: I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon, complied by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record, can you please read page 57, paragraph four?
James Rhodes / War Machine: You're requesting that I read specific selections from my report, Senator?
Senator Stern: Yes, sir.
James Rhodes / War Machine: It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.
Senator Stern: I understand. A lot of things have changed today. So if you could just read 
James Rhodes / War Machine: You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect the summery of my final 
Senator Stern: Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Very well. "As he does not operate within any definable branch of government, Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation and to her interests." I did however, go on to summarise that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh three liabilities and that it would be in our interest 
Senator Stern: That's enough Colonel
James Rhodes / War Machine:  to fold Mr Stark 
Senator Stern: That's enough
James Rhodes / War Machine:  into the existing chain of command, Senator.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm not a joiner, but I'll consider Secretary of Defence, if you ask nice.
[Laughs from crowd.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: We can amend the hours a little bit.
Senator Stern: I'd like to go on and show, if I may, the imagery that's connected to your report.
James Rhodes / War Machine: I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images to the general public at this time.
Senator Stern: With all due respect, Colonel, I understand. And if you could just narrate those for us, we'd be very grateful. Let's have the images.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies of Mr Stark's suit. This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground 
[Tony is doing something on a Stark device]
James Rhodes / War Machine:   indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Hold on a second buddy. Let me see something here. [Sets up his device to connect with the screen showing the pictures.] Boy, I'm good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let's see what's really going on.
Senator Stern: What is he doing?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: If you will direct your attention to said screens, I believe that's North Korea. [Video of a suit. It falls over and clearly doesn't work very well at all.]
Senator Stern: Can you turn that off? Take it off. [Justin Hammer stands up]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Iran.
[This suit can fly. For all of five seconds before crashing, judging by the smoke, probably on fire. Justin is by the screen, trying to find the off switch.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: No grave threat here. Is that Justin Hammer? How did Hammer get in the game?
[Yep, it's a video of Justin Hammer. With a suit. Again that really doesn't work.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Justin, you're on TV. Focus up.
TV Justin Hammer: Okay, give me a left twist. Left's good. Turn to the right. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
[Language Justin]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [Just as not-TV Justin finds the plug and unplugs the screen] Wow. Yeah, I'd say most countries, five, ten years away. Hammer Industries, twenty.
Justin Hammer: I'd like to point out that that test pilot survived.
Senator Stern: I think we're done is the point that he's making. I don't think there's any reason 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: The point is, you're welcome, I guess
Senator Stern: For what?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Because I'm your nuclear deterrent. It's working. We're safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can't have it. But I did you a big favour.
[Stands up and turns around to face the crowd]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I've successfully privatised world peace.
[Both hands make peace signs and everyone stands up, all talking at once]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: What more do you want? For now! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.
Senator Stern: [beep] you, Mr Stark. [beep] you, buddy. We're adjourned. We're adjourned for today.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [puts on sunglasses. Rhodey's still sitting down and has the same look on his face as Pepper did. Basically, they're both tired of Tony not taking serious things seriously] Okay.
Senator Stern: You've been a delight.
[Kind of scene change. It's now on a television on a Russian news channel with Russian dubbing. Because it's a film where the selected language is English, we can still here the English clearer than the Russian. We're back to Ivan.]
Tony (on TV): My bond is with the people. And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself. If there's one thing I've proven it's that you can count on me to pleasure myself.
[Ivan is still working. There's things going blue. It works. It's not a full suit, but it does now look like he has whips made of lightning. Scene change. Tony's house. He's in his workshop. Pans in from across the ocean]
MALIBU, CALIFORNIA
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Wake up, Daddy's home.
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Welcome home, sir. Congratulations on the opening ceremonies. They were such a success, as was your Senate hearing. And may I say how refreshing it is to finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.
[One of the robots is trying to make a smoothie. Without a blender lid]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You!
[You knocks over the blender. Well, he tried.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I swear to God I'll dismantle you. I'll soak your motherboard. I'll turn you into a wine rack.
[You looks down, sad.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: How many ounce a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.
[Tony downs green liquid]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Check palladium levels.
[Using the same machine as before]
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Blood toxicity, 24%. It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition. Another core has been depleted.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [Takes Arc Reactor out of chest. The core pops out, rusted and slightly smoking.] God, they're running out quick.
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: I have run simulations on every known element, and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core.
[Tony inputs a new core. It's silver, giving a judgment of just how badly damaged the other one was. Replaces Arc Reactor in chest.]
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: You are running out of both time and options. Unfortunately, the device that's keeping you alive is also killing you.
[Which we can see from the image of Tony's chest on the computer screen. There's blue lines all around the Arc Reactor. Camera angle shifts to focus on his actual chest.]
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Miss Potts is approaching. I recommend that you inform her 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Mute.
[Shirt back down, computers switched to screen saver, Pepper inputs a code and opens the door]
Pepper Potts: Is this a joke? What are you thinking?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: What?
Pepper Potts: What are you thinking?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy. And you're angry about something. Do you have the sniffles? I don't want to get sick.
Pepper Potts: Did you just donate 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Keep your business.
[Both walking around the room]
Pepper Potts:  our entire modern art collection to the 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Boy Scouts of America.
Pepper Potts:  Boy Scouts of America?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation. I didn't physically check the crates but, basically, yes. And it's not "our" collection, it's my collection. No offence.
Pepper Potts: No, you know what? I think I'm actually entitled to say "our" collection considering the time that I put in, over 10 years, curating that.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: It was a tax write-off. I needed that.
Pepper Potts: You know, there's only about 8,011 things that I really need to talk to you about.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [to another robot] Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out. The Bridgeport's already machining that part.
Pepper Potts: The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I need you to wear a surgical mask until you're feeling better. Is that okay?
Pepper Potts: That's rude.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: There's nothing more important to me than the Expo. It's my primary point of concern. I don't know why you're 
Pepper Potts: The Expo is your ego gone crazy.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [Picking up a painting. Of Iron Man] Wow. Look at that. That's modern art. That's going up.
Pepper Potts: You've got to be kidding.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm gonna put this up right now. This is vital.
Pepper Potts: Stark is in complete disarray. You understand that?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: No. Our stocks have never been higher.
Pepper Potts: Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You are  Well, if's messy then let's double back.
Pepper Potts: Let me give you an example.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Let's move onto another subject.
Pepper Potts: No, no, no, no. You are not taking down the Barnett Newman and hanging that up.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm not taking it down. I'm just replacing it with this.
[Tony is now stood on a desk about to take down the Barnett Newman to put the Iron Man picture up].
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Let's see what I can get going on here.
Pepper Potts: Okay, fine. My point is, we have already awarded contracts to the wind farm people.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah. Don't say "wind farm." I'm already feeling gassy.
Pepper Potts: And to the plastic plantation tree, which was your idea by the way. Those people are on payroll 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Everything was my idea.
Pepper Potts:  and you won't make a decision.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I don't care about the liberal agenda any more. It's boring. Boring. I'm giving you a boring alert. [Jumps off desk] You do it.
Pepper Potts: I do what?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.
Pepper Potts: Yeah, I'm trying to run the company.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Pepper, I need you to run the company. Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
Pepper Potts: You will not give me the information 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm not asking you to try 
Pepper Potts:  in order to 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm asking you to physically do it. I need you to do it.
Pepper Potts: I am trying to do it.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Pepper, you're not listening to me!
Pepper Potts: No, you are not listening to me.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm trying to make you CEO. Why won't you let me?
Pepper Potts: Have you been drinking?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Chlorophyll. I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries effective immediately. Yeah, done deal. Okay? I've actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not. [One of the robots brings him a tray which a bottle and glasses on it] Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak, trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be. And then I realised it's you. It's always been you. [Pours champagne. Pepper sits down, shocked and confused]. I thought there'd be a legal issue, but actually I'm capable of appointing my successor. My successor being you. [Hands her a glass. She doesn't take it.] Congratulations? Take it, just take it.
Pepper Potts: I don't know what to think.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Don't think, drink. There you go. [They tap glasses and drink]
[We're back in Russia. A man hands Ivan a letter down a twitten, out of sight. It contains a fake passport and a ticket. Another scene change. Tony and Happy are boxing. Pepper walks in.]
Pepper Potts: The notary's here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm on happy time. [Tony hits Happy in the face with his elbow] Sorry.
Happy Hogan: What the hell was that?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: It's called mixed martial arts. It's been around for three weeks.
Happy Hogan: It's called dirty boxing, there's nothing new about it
Tony Stark / Iron Man: All right, put them up. Come on. [The Notary walks in. Both Happy and Tony's attention shifts to her]
Pepper Potts: I promise this is the only time I will ask you to sign over your company.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: I need you to initial each box.
Happy Hogan: [Taps Tony on the back of the head with a light punch, not enough to hurt him] Lesson one. Never take your eye off  [Tony kicks him and he goes crashing into the corner of the ring. Camera angle shifts to Pepper and the Notary and clangs are heard.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: That's it. I'm done. What's your name, lady?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Rushman. Natalie Rushman [So we shall now refer to the Notary as Natalie]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Front and centre. Come into the church.
Pepper Potts: No. You're seriously not gonna ask 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: If it pleases the court, which it does.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: [To Pepper] It's no problem.
Pepper Potts: [To Natalie] I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.
[Natalie enters ring. Tony swigs down more green liquid out of a bottle]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Can you give her a lesson?
Happy Hogan: No problem.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [Steps out of ring and towards Pepper] Pepper.
Pepper Potts: What?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [Sitting down next to Pepper] Who is she?
Pepper Potts: She is from legal. And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her like that.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I need a new assistant, boss.
Pepper Potts: Yes, and I've got three excellent potential candidates. They're lined up and ready to meet you.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I don't have time to meet. I need someone now. I feel like it's her.
Pepper Potts: No, it's not.
Happy Hogan: You ever boxed before?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: I have, yes.
Happy Hogan: What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that? [Natalie's face shows brief annoyance at his statement before Tony distracts her]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: How do I spell your name, Natalie?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: R-U-S-H-M-A-N.
Pepper Potts: What, are you gonna google her now?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I thought I was ogling her. [Brings up Natalie's file on table which doubles up as a computer. He has computers on everything.] Wow. Very, very impressive individual.
Pepper Potts: You're so predictable, you know that?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: She's fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin. Who speaks Latin?
Pepper Potts: No one speaks Latin.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: No one speaks Latin
Pepper Potts: It's a dead language. You can read Latin or you can write Latin, but you can't speak Latin.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Did you model in Tokyo? ‘Cause she modelled in Tokyo.
Pepper Potts: Well 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I need her. She's got everything that I need. [Camera is now on Natalie and Happy, Natalie looking over, hearing what Tony is saying]
Happy Hogan: Rule number one, never take your eyes off your opponent. [He goes to take a swing, she grabs his hand and flips him over, legs over his head.]
Pepper Potts: Oh, my God! Happy.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: That's what I'm talking about.
Happy Hogan: I just slipped.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You did?
Happy Hogan: [Who looks a little like he's in pain] Yeah.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Looks like a TKO to me. [Rings the bell and Natalie leaves the ring]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Just  I need your impression.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You have a quiet reserve. I don't know, you have an old soul.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: I meant your fingerprint.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Right.
Pepper Potts: So, how are we doing?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Great. Just wrapping up here. Hey. You're the boss.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Will that be all, Mr Stark?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: No.
Pepper Potts: Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman. Thank you very much. [She leaves. Tony turns to Pepper]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I want one.
Pepper Potts: No.
[News report is heard. In French. It's about the Grand Prix.
Tony, Pepper and Happy are seen leaving a car and walking into a building. Happy is carrying a red suitcase]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You know, it's Europe. Whatever happens the next 20 minutes, just go with it.
Pepper Potts: Go with it? Go with what?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Mr Stark?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Hey.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Hello. How was your flight?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: It was excellent. Boy, it's nice to see you.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: We have one photographer from the ACM, if you don't mind. Okay?
Pepper Potts: When did this happen?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: What? You made me do it.
Pepper Potts: I made you do what?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You quit. Smile. Look, right there. Stop acting constipated. Don't flare your nostrils.
Pepper Potts: You are so predictable.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: That's the amazing thing.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Right this way.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You look fantastic.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Why, thank you very much.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: But that's unprofessional. What's on the docket?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: You have a 9:30 dinner.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Perfect. I'll be there at 11:00.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Absolutely.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Is this us?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: It can be.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Great. Make it us.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Okay.
Pepper Potts: Mr Musk. How are you?
Mr Musk: Hi, Pepper. Congratulations on the promotion.
Pepper Potts: Thank you very much.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Elon, how's it going. Those Merlin engines are fantastic.
Mr Musk: Thank you. Yeah, I've got an idea for an electric jet.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You do?
Mr Musk: Yeah.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Then we'll make it work. [To Pepper as they walk] You want a massage?
Pepper Potts: Oh, God. No. I don't want a massage.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'll have Natalie make an 
Pepper Potts: I don't want Natalie to do 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Don't want you tense. By the way, I didn't mean to spring this on you.
Pepper Potts: Thank you very much.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Green is not your best colour. [Justin's head appears from behind someone]
Pepper Potts: Oh, please.
Justin Hammer: Anthony. Is that you?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [To Pepper] My least favourite person on Earth.
Justin Hammer: Hey, pal.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Justin Hammer.
Justin Hammer: How you doing? You're not the only rich guy here with a fancy car. You know Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair. You guys know each other? [She appears.]
Christine Everhart: Hi. Yes.
Pepper Potts: Yes.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yes, roughly.
Pepper Potts: We do.
Justin Hammer: BTW, big story. The new CEO of Stark Industries.
Christine Everhart: I know, I know.
Justin Hammer: Congratulations.
Christine Everhart: My editor will kill me if I don't grab a quote for our Powerful Women issue.
Pepper Potts: Oh.
Christine Everhart: Can I?
Pepper Potts: Sure.
Justin Hammer: She's actually doing a big spread on me for Vanity Fair. I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know. Right?
Pepper Potts: Right. Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: And she wrote a story as well.
Pepper Potts: It was very impressive.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: That was good.
Pepper Potts: It was very well done.
Christine Everhart: Thank you.
Pepper Potts: I'm gonna go wash.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Don't leave me.
Justin Hammer: Hey, buddy. How you doing?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm all right.
Justin Hammer: Looking gorgeous.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Please, this is tough.
Christine Everhart: Can I ask you  Is this the first time 
Justin Hammer: [Posing for a camera while Tony replaces sunglasses and tries to escape] Fromage [French for cheese. That bit did have a subtitle] Say "Brie".
Christine Everhart:  that you guys have seen each other?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: God, that's so awful.
Christine Everhart: Listen, is it the first time you've seen each other since the Senate?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Since he got his contract revoked 
Justin Hammer: Actually, it's on hold.
Tony Stark / Iron Man:  when you were attempting to That's not what I heard. What's the difference between hold and cancelled? The truth?
Christine Everhart: Yes, what is it?
Justin Hammer: No. The truth is  Why don't we put that away? The truth is, I'm actually hoping to present something at your Expo.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Well, if you invent something that works, I'll make sure I get you a slot.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Mr Stark?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yes?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Your corner table is ready.
Justin Hammer: I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Hammer needs a slot, Christine.
Justin Hammer: We kid, yeah. We kid. We're kidders.
[Tony is doing another test. It reads Blood toxicity 53%. He's in a bathroom.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [In the mirror] Got any other bad ideas?
[And now he's in a racing suit, jumping over the barrier towards a car.]
Justin Hammer: [Still inside, talking to Christine.] Tony and I  Tony  I love Tony Stark. Tony loves me. We're not competitors. Him being out of the picture created tremendous opportunities for Hammer Industries, you know? Everything that Tony and I do 
Tony (on TV behind Justin): Well, what's the use of having 
Justin Hammer:  is a healthy 
Tony Stark / Iron Man:  and owning a race car 
Justin Hammer:  competition.
Tony Stark / Iron Man:  if you don't drive it?
Justin Hammer: Is he driving?
[Camera shift to Pepper sitting at her table, probably waiting for Tony. She notices the television.]
Pepper Potts: Natalie. Natalie!
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Yes, Ms Potts?
Pepper Potts: What do you know about this?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: This is the first that I have known of it.
Pepper Potts: This, this cannot happen.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Absolutely. I understand. How can I help you?
Pepper Potts: Where's Happy?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: He's waiting outside.
Pepper Potts: Okay, get him. I need Happy.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Right away.
Justin Hammer: Tony's You know, he We're not competitive. You know what I mean?
Christine Everhart: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, can you excuse me just one second?
Justin Hammer: Just read me what you wrote.
Christine Everhart: I will. I will, after.
Justin Hammer: Just read it back to me.
Christine Everhart: But I have to make one quick phone call.
Justin Hammer: Where are you going?
Christine Everhart: This is great.
Justin Hammer: I've got some caviar coming.
Christine Everhart: This is great stuff. I'll be right back.
Someone in background: Look! That's Stark.
[And engines revving, set, go! The race takes off. A man dressed in orange as pit crew walks beside the track. He looks familiar. Tony's surprisingly not bad at this race car driving. Orange man is on the track. Oh look, it's Ivan. More French words. I got a "Mon Dieu" I think. The lightning whips strike a car. Pepper looks terrified. For Tony. Another "Mon Dieu" from the French commentator. Means "My God" by the way. Happy appears at the door and holds up the briefcase. Pepper goes with him to the car and gets in the back.]
Pepper Potts: Go, go.
Happy Hogan: Hang on. [Crashes through a barrier onto the track heading the opposite way to the race cars. Tony's car gets hit and he goes flying, loosing the front. Ivan heads forward. Another car gets hit. Bit of fire. Dripping petrol. Never a good sign.]
Pepper Potts: Give me the case.
Happy Hogan: Here, take it.
Pepper Potts: Where's the key?
Happy Hogan: It's in my pocket.
Pepper Potts: Car!
[Ivan slices more of Tony's car, but he's gone. Tony comes up from behind him and whacks him around the head with a sheet of metal. Fighting. Tony is knocked on the floor. Sees dripping petrol. Ivan begins to swings the whips. Tony moves, hits petrol and the car bursts into flames. Happy appears, driving and runs Ivan into the fence. Tony is up the fence]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Are you okay?
Happy Hogan: Yeah.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Were you heading from me or him?
Happy Hogan: I was trying to scare him.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: ‘Cause I can't tell!
Pepper Potts: Are you out of your mind?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Better security.
Pepper Potts: Get in the car right now!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I was attacked. We need better security.
Happy Hogan: Get in the car.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You're CEO. Better security measures. God, it's embarrassing. [Ivan's head moves. Tony opens the door] First vacation in two years. [And Ivan slices the door in half. Darn it Ivan, it's a Rolls, be nicer to her]
Pepper Potts: Oh my God! [Happy reverses a bit and runs into Ivan again.]
Happy Hogan: I got him!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Hit him again. Hit him again. Football.
Happy Hogan: I got him.
Pepper Potts: Take the case! Take it!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Give him the case!
Pepper Potts: Stop banging the car! [Out comes the airbag and Ivan slices the car in half. He continues to slice at the car]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Calm down.
Pepper Potts: God. God.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Give me the case! Please! Come on! [Pepper throws the case, Tony stand on it and it turns into the Iron Man Suit! A fight begins. Which involves more damage to the car and damage to the Iron Man suit. Tony rips out the Arc Reactor, shutting off Ivan's suit.]
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: [Being taken away by the police] You  You lose. You lose Stark. [Justin smiles.]
[Scene change. In a prison.]
Police officer [French]: On a vérifié ses empreintes et on n'a rien trouvé, même pas son nom. ([subtitled] We ran his prints. We got nothing back, not even a name.)
Tony [French]: Où allons-nous ? ([subtitled:] Where are we going?)
Police Officer [French]: Par là. En fait on ne sait même pas s'il parle. Il a pas dit un mot depuis qu'il est arrivé, pas un son. ([subtitled:] Over there. We're not even sure he speaks English. He hasn't said a word since he got here.)
Tony [French]: Cinq minutes ([subtitled:] Five minutes.)
Police officer [French]: [opening door] (Tony [French]: Non, non s'il vous plaît tout ira bien). Five minutes. {Door is shut behind Tony.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low. You could have doubled up your rotations. You focused the repulsor energy through ionised plasma channels. It's effective. Not very efficient. But it's a passable knock-off. I don't get it. A little fine tuning you could have made a solid pay check. You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran, or gone onto the black market. You look like you got friends in low places.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: You come from a family of thieves and butchers. And now, like all guilty men, you try to rewrite your own history. And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: My father. Anton Vanko.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Well, I never heard of him.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: My father is the reason you're alive.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: The reason I'm alive is ‘cause you had a shot, you took it, you missed.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: Did I? If you can make God bleed, the people will cease to believe in him. And there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come. The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch as the world will consume you.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Where will you be watching the world consume me from? That's right. A prison cell. I'll send you a bar of soap. [He gets up to leave]
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: Hey, Tony. Before you go, palladium in the chest, painful way to die. [Tony leaves the cell]
[Scene change. On Tony's private aeroplane. Stern is on the television]
Senator Stern: It's just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle and this man has no idea what he's doing. He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy. I was at a hearing where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant that these suits can't exist anywhere else, don't exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else, at least for five to ten years, and here we are in Monaco realising, "These suits exist now."
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Mute. He should be giving me a medal. That's the truth.
Pepper Potts: What is that?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: This is your in-flight meal.
Pepper Potts: Did you just make that?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah. Where do you think I've been for three hours?
Pepper Potts: Tony, what are you not telling me?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I don't want to go home. At all. Let's cancel my birthday party and  We're in Europe. Let's go to Venice, Cipriani. Remember?
Pepper Potts: Oh, yes.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: It's a great place to be healthy.
Pepper Potts: I don't think this is the right time. We're in kind of a mess.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah, but maybe that's why it's the best time. ‘Cause then we can 
Pepper Potts: Well, I think as the CEO I need to show up.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.
Pepper Potts: A leave?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: A company retreat.
Pepper Potts: A retreat? During a time like this?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Just a ride. Well, I'm just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.
Pepper Potts: Not everybody runs on batteries Tony.
[Ivan is in a cell. A guard drops of food. Someone's left a note about enjoying the potatoes. That would be easier if they were potatoes and not an explosive. A man enters, dressed like Ivan, down to the number. Ivan escapes. More French shouting. There was defiantly an "allez" in there. Ivan gets knocked out. He awakens somewhere else]
Justin Hammer: Hey. There he is. There he is. What an absolute pleasure. Welcome. Oh goodness gracious. Can we get the handcuffs off my friend here? Forgive me, I'm sorry. I'm such a huge fan of yours. I didn't want to make a first impression like this. He's not an animal. Come on. He's a human being. Thank you. We're fine. My name is Justin Hammer. I'd like to do some business with you. Please sit. Dig in. What do we have today Jack?
Jack: We have some salmon carpaccio.
Justin Hammer: Salmon carpaccio. Anything you want here, we got it. I like my dessert first. I had this flown in from San Francisco. It's Italian though. Organic ice cream. I got a sweet tooth. Apparently you do too, for Tony Stark. What I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track, how you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody that was Wow. You spoke to me with what you did. And I know that you knew that I'd be listening. This is why I couldn't bear to have you shipped off to God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent. But if I might make a suggestion, you know, you don't just go and try to kill the guy. I think, if I may, you go after his legacy. That's what you kill. You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways. The only difference between you and I is that I have resources. I think, if I may, you need my resources. Someone behind you, a benefactor. I'd like to be that guy.
Ivan [Russian]: Если меня убьют, не буди меня. Лучше умереть, чем жить в своем мире. [no subs in the movie; If I'm killed, don't wake me. It is better to die than to live in your world.]
Justin Hammer: Okay. Do you speak English? Because I can get a translator. I don't know. Have you been understanding everything I'm saying?
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: Very good, man.
Justin Hammer: Very good, man.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: Very good, man.
Justin Hammer: Hey!
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: [clinking bottle with Justin's glass] Hey.
Justin Hammer: Yes?
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: I want my bird.
Justin Hammer: A bird? You want a bird?
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: I want my bird.
Justin Hammer: I can get you a bird. I can get you ten birds.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: I want my bird.
Justin Hammer: Well, okay. Nothing's impossible. I could  Are we talking about  Is this a bird back in Russia?
[Scene change. Pepper and Natalie are back in Malibu.]
Pepper Potts: [on phone] Yes, but the fundamentals of the company are still very, very strong despite the events in Monaco.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: [also on phone. But a different phone] Yes, of course. [To Pepper] The AP wants a quote.
Pepper Potts: [covers speaker] Don't tell them. Fax them 
James Rhodes / War Machine: [entering] Where is he?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: He doesn't want to be disturbed.
Pepper Potts: He's downstairs.
News reader (on television): But what happened in Monaco?
Pepper Potts: Yes, but .
News reader: But his continuing erratic behaviour may lead many people to ask themselves, "Can this man still protect us?"
Pepper Potts: Iron Man never stopped protecting us. The events in Monaco proved that.
[Scene change. Tony is sitting in a car in his workshop looking at holograms.]
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Query complete sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist who defected to the United States in 1963.However, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967. His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist, was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons grade plutonium to Pakistan, and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison. No further records exist. [Rhodey enters]
James Rhodes / War Machine: Tony, you gotta get upstairs and get on top of this situation right now. Listen. I've been on the phone with the National Guard all day, trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH, knocking down your front door and taking these. They're gonna take your suits, Tony, okay? They're sick of the games. You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years. Well, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday. It's not theoretical anymore. Are you listening to me? Are you okay?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Let's go. [Gets out the car. And falls.]
James Rhodes / War Machine: Hey, man. Hey, hey! You all right?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah, I should get to my desk. [Rhodey supports him] See that cigar box?
James Rhodes / War Machine: Yeah.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: It's palladium.
James Rhodes / War Machine: [Tony removes Arc Reactor] Is that supposed to be smoking?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: If you must know, it's neutron damage. It's from the reactor wall.
James Rhodes / War Machine: You had this in your body? And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Road rash. Thank you. [Replaces Arc Reactor and starts drinking green liquid again.] What are you looking at?
James Rhodes / War Machine: I'm looking at you. You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act and it's unnecessary. You don't have to do this alone.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do. But you've gotta trust me. Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I'm doing.
QUEENS, NEW YORK.
Justin Hammer: This is where we do it. This is my humble abode. You can work in absolute peace. Must be fun to be dead, right? No pressure. Here they are. I'm very excited. They're combat-ready. I may have done a few miscalculations and rushed the prototype into production. Sue me, I'm enthusiastic. Go ahead, take a look around. [Ivan puts on glasses and heads towards a computer] You don't wanna do that. You'll be able to access that as soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes. Can we generate some encrypted pass codes? Get some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack. Never mind, I  Wow. Okay. Good stuff.
Ivan [Russian]: Твой софт говно!
Justin Hammer: Sorry?
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: Software shit.
Justin Hammer: Well  You're good. You really blasted in past the firewall there. Let me show you where you're gonna be working primarily. Go ahead, take a look. Get a good look at that. That's something, isn't it? You know, those are really just for show and tell. They're $125.7 million a pop, so  Wait! [Ivan pulls off one's head] Oh gosh. Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here. That's where the pilot goes. I'm having a tough time finding volunteers. I'll take care of that, just leave it.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: What you want them do?
Justin Hammer: Well, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years. I want to make Iron Man look like an antique. I wanna go to that Stark Expo, I wanna take a dump in Tony Stark's front yard. You know what I'm talking about?
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: I can do that. No problem.
Justin Hammer: Yeah? Hey, fabulous! I love it. Hey, this is our guy. Didn't I tell you? I had a feeling.
[Tony's rash on his chest is getting worse. Natalie enters.]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Do you know which watch you'd like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'll give them a look. I should cancel the party.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Probably.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah. ‘Cause it's 
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Ill-timed.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Right, sends the wrong message.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Inappropriate. [Tony drinks a bit of his drink that Natalie hands him] Is that dirty enough for you?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Gold face, brown hand. The Jaeger. I'll give that a look. Bring them over. [Natalie hands him the box of watches] I'll take that. Why don't you  [She sits, smiles softly and starts helping him cover his bruise] I gotta say it. It's hard to get a read on you. Where are you from?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Legal.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Can I ask you a question, hypothetically? Bit odd. If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have, how would you celebrate it?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: I'd do whatever I wanted to do with whoever I wanted to do it with. [She leaves Tony finishes his drink. Scene change. He's now drunk, by a DJ, dancing in the suit. Cars pull up outside]
Person: Good evening
Person: Good evening
James Rhodes / War Machine: Yes, sir, I understand. No. No, sir, that will not be necessary. I'll handle it. Sir, I personally guarantee that within 24 hours, Iron Man will be back on watch. [Enters party] Hey Pepper.
Pepper Potts: I'm going to get some air.
James Rhodes / War Machine: What's wrong?
Pepper Potts: [Showing Rhodey Tony] I don't know what to do.
James Rhodes / War Machine: You gotta be kidding me. [Tony falls over, drunk] That's it, I'm making .
Pepper Potts: No, no, no. Don't call anyone.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Pepper. This is ridiculous. I just stuck my neck out for this guy.
Pepper Potts: I know. I know. I get it. I'm gonna handle it, okay Just let me handle it.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Handle it. Or I'm gonna have to.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [To crowd] You know, the question I get asked most often is, "Tony, how do you go to the bathroom in the suit?" Just like that. [Cheering. Pepper walks up to him]
Pepper Potts: Does this guy know how to throw a party or what?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I love you.
Pepper Potts: Unbelievable! Thank you so much. Tony, we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night. And we're gonna say good night now, and thank you all for coming.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: No, no, no, we can't   Wait, wait, wait. We didn't have the cake. We didn't blow out the candles.
Pepper Potts: You're out of control, okay? Trust me on this, okay?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You're out of control gorgeous.
Pepper Potts: It's time to go to bed. It's time.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Give me another smooch
Pepper Potts: You're not going to be happy about this.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Come on, you know you want to.
Pepper Potts: You just peed in the suit.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I know. It has a filtration system.
Pepper Potts: It's not sexy.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You could drink that water.
Pepper Potts: Just send everybody home, okay? It's time to 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: If you say so.
Pepper Potts: Okay. I'll take this, you take that [exchanges microphone for bottle]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Pepper Potts. She's right. The party's over. Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago. The after-party starts in 15 minutes. And if anybody, Pepper, doesn't like it, there's the door. [accidently shoots it with the suit.] Yeah! [Girl throws bottle it the air] Hit! [Rhodey leaves as he shoots it] Pull! [Rhodey goes downstairs. Drunk girl is still throwing things for Tony to shoot. Rhodey gets into one of the suits. Another girl appears with a watermelon] I think she wants the Gallagher!
James Rhodes / War Machine: [In full suit] I'm only gonna say this once. Get out. [Helmet slips down. Everybody leaves.] You don't deserve to wear one of these. Shut it down!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [To DJ] Goldstein.
Goldstein: Yes, Mr Stark?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy's ass to. [Laughs. Another One Bites the Dust by Queen starts to play.]
James Rhodes / War Machine: [Grabbing hold on Tony from behind] I told you to shut it down. [Tony takes off backwards]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Now, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt. [Rhodey throws things at him] Really? [Tony hits him with a set of weights] Sorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.
James Rhodes / War Machine: [Hitting Tony with a pipe] Sidekick this. [Tony goes up throw the ceiling.] Had enough?
[Quick camera angle shift]
Pepper Potts: Natalie!
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Miss Potts.
Pepper Potts: Don't you "Miss Potts" me! I'm on to you. You know what? Ever since you came here  [Tony and Rhodey come crashing through the ceiling]
Happy Hogan: Pepper! [Runs in to get her out of the way] Get out of here. Get out of here now. [Natalie heads off somewhere.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You want it? Take it! [Beats Rhodey and turns to growl at crowd, who run off. Rhodey gets back up]
James Rhodes / War Machine: Put you hand down.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?
James Rhodes / War Machine: We don't have to do this, Tony.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Put it down!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You gonna take a shot?
James Rhodes / War Machine: Put it down!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: No!
James Rhodes / War Machine: Drop it Tony!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Take it! [Their blasts meet and there goes Tony's house. Both of them are knocked backwards. Tony looks around and sees Rhodey take off in the suit.]
EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE
MOJAVE, CA
James Rhodes / War Machine: Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, inbound from three miles east at 5,000 feet  [Rhodey lands in suit.]
Major Allen: Colonel.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Major.
Major Allen: Wow.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Yeah. Let's take it inside.
Major Allen: Clear the area.
[Scene change. Tony is sitting inside a doughnut, eating a doughnut. Pans out to see Nick Fury looking up at him.]
Nick Fury: Sir! I'm gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [Now inside sitting at a table with Fury] I told you I don't wanna join your super-secret boy band.
Nick Fury: No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself. How's that working out for you?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: It's  It's  It's  I'm sorry. I don't wanna get off on the wrong foot. Do I look at the patch or the eye? Honestly I'm a bit hung over. I'm not sure if you're real of if I'm having 
Nick Fury: I am very real. I'm the realest person you're ever gonna meet.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Just my luck. Where's the staff here?
Nick Fury: That's not looking so good.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I've been worse. [A woman walks over. Camera angle is such that you can't see her face.]
SHIELD agent: We've secured the perimeter but I don't think we should hold it for too much longer.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [Looks over top of glasses. Sees Natalie.] You're fired.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: That's not up to you. [Sits down next to Fury]
Nick Fury: Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Hi.
Natalie/Agent Romanoff: I'm a SHIELD shadow. Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I suggest you apologise.
Nick Fury: You've been very busy. You made your girl your CEO, you're giving away all your stuff. You let your friend fly away with your suit. Now, if I didn't know better 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You don't know better. I didn't give it to him. He took it.
Nick Fury: Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it? You're Iron Man and he just took it? The little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit? [Turns to Agent Romanoff] Is that possible?
Agent Romanoff: Well, according to Mr Stark's database security guidelines, there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: What do you want from me?
Nick Fury: What do we want from you? What do you want from me? [Agent Romanoff leaves] You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with. Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe. I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with. [Romanoff returns with an injection] Hit him.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Oh, God, are gonna steal my kidney and sell it? [Rash goes down] Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds? What did she just do to me?
Nick Fury: What did we just do for you? That's lithium dioxide. It's gonna take the edge off. We're trying to get you back to work.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Give me a couple of boxes of that. I'll be right as rain.
Agent Romanoff: It's not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.
Nick Fury: Doesn't look like it's gonna be an easy fix.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Trust me, I know. I'm good at this stuff. I've been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium. I've tried every combination, every permutation of every known element.
Nick Fury: Well, I'm here to tell you, you haven't tried them all.
[Scene change. Hammer Industries]
Justin Hammer: Hey, hey, het. Special delivery. Candygram. [Ivan climbs down from where he was working] I brought you something. Oh yeah. [Removes cloth] We got you the bird, pal.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: This is not my bird.
Justin Hammer: What do you mean? That's the bird. This is the bird. Yeah, pulled a lot of strings to get this bird. This is a great bird.
Jack: It's a beautiful bird.
Justin Hammer: We got this bird all the way from Russia.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: Hey, man, this is not my bird.
Justin Hammer: Well, listen, even if it's not the bird, I mean, this is a gorgeous bird. I mean, you know, look, don't get so attached to things. Learn to let go. Wait a minute. Jack, what is that? Is that  That's not a helmet. What is that? [Walks up to suit] Ivan  What's this? Jack. Is that a helmet? It doesn't look like a helmet to me. How  How are you supposed to get a head in there? Jack, could you put your head in there?
Jack: No.
Justin Hammer: Try to put your head in there. Go ahead. Try to put your head in there. [Jack put it on his head] See, Ivan? He can't put his head in there. That's  That's not a helmet. It's a head. I need to put a guy in there. I need to fit a person in that suit. You understand?
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: Drone better.
Justin Hammer: What? Drone better? Why is drone better? Why is drone better?
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: People make problem. Trust me. Drone better.
Justin Hammer: Ivan, you know, I like you. I got you the bird. You said, "No problem." That's what you said to me. You said, "No problem." Now I need suits. The government wants suits. Like Iron Man. You understand? That's what the people want. That's what's gonna make them happy.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: Hey, man. Don't get too attached to things. Learn to let go.
Justin Hammer: These drones better steal the show, Ivan. You understand? Better rock my world, Ivan.
[Scene change. Air base]
General: Unbelievable. This ought to get the Senate off my ass. It's functional?
James Rhodes / War Machine: Fully mission-capable.
General: Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponise it.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Sir?
General: Justin Hammer's making a weapons presentation at the Expo. We'd like this to introduce it.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Sir, I don't believe that the Expo 
General: Colonel, the world needs to see this fast. We've got to make this happen.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Yes, General, but 
General: It's also an order.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Yes sir.
General: Good work, Colonel. You've made your country proud.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Thank you sir.
[Scene change. Tony's house. It's a bit broken. He is sitting with Nick Fury.]
Nick Fury: That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: No, it was finished. It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my 
Nick Fury: No. Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater. He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race. He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Just him, or Anton Vanko in on this too?
Nick Fury: Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin. Anton saw it as a way to get rich. When your father found out, he had him deported. When the Russians found out he couldn't deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage. Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in, the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You told me I hadn't tried everything. What do you mean I haven't tried everything? What haven't I tried?
Nick Fury: He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: He said that?
Nick Fury: Are you that guy? Are you? ‘Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I don't know where you get your information, but he wasn't my biggest fan.
Nick Fury: What do you remember about your dad?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it's a little tough for me to digest when you're telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he's passing it down. I don't get that. You're talking about a guy who's happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school.
Nick Fury: That's not true.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.
Nick Fury: As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: What?
Nick Fury: I got a two o'clock
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's this?
Nick Fury: Okay, you're good, right?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: No, I'm not good.
Nick Fury: You got this? Right? Right?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Got what? I don't even know what I'm supposed to get.
Nick Fury: Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact. You remember Agent Coulson, right?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah.
Nick Fury: And Tony, remember, I got my eye on you. [Fury leaves]
Natalie/Agent Romanoff/Natasha (We'll stick with Natasha from now on): We've disabled all communications. No contact with the outside world. Good luck. [She leaves]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [Turning to Agent Coulson] Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I'll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that'd be nice.
Agent Phil Coulson: I'm not here for that. I've been authorised by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises. If you attempt to leave or play any games, I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet. Okay?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I think I got it, yeah.
Agent Phil Coulson: Enjoy your evening's entertainment. [Leaves. Tony looks at the box that has been left for him.]
[Scene change. Air base. Dismantling the suit]
Major Allen: Think this is the power source?
James Rhodes / War Machine: Major, this is not a scientific exercise. Let's just focus on arming it, all right?
Major Allen: Yes, sir.
Justin Hammer: [Entering. Sucking on a red lollipop.] Oh, yes! Oh, yes, yes, yes. Is it my birthday? You got it. What did you do? What did you do? Is this what I think it is?
James Rhodes / War Machine: Yes it is. Hammer, I want to know what you're gonna do for us.
Justin Hammer: What am I going to do for you? Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for you is I'm gonna upgrade your software. And then, second, I think I should 
James Rhodes / War Machine: That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about firepower.
Justin Hammer: Well, you're talking to the right guy. [Bites lollipop. Time jump. Kind of. He now has weapons to show to Rhodey.] Claridge Hi-Tec, semi-automatic, 9mm pistol. Too downtown? I agree. M24 shotgun, pump action. Five-round magazine. You know what? You're not a hunter. What am I talking about? I'm getting rid of it. This is the FN-2000 from Belgium. They do make something better than waffles. It's beautiful, But I can tell this isn't disco enough for you, so I'm gonna put it right here. You're looking at a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher. Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control. You're tough. Let me tell you something. Size does matter. Don't let anyone tell you different. This is an M134 7.62 Minigun. Six invidual barrels. The torso taker, powder maker. Our boys in uniform call in Uncle Gazpacho or Puff the Magic Dragon. Okay. These are the Cubans, baby. This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos. This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle with a secondary cyclotrimethlyenetrinitamine RDX burst. It's capable of busting the bunker under the bunker you just busted. If it were any smarter, it would write a book. A book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon. It would read it to you. This is my Eiffel Tower. This is my Rachmaninoff's Third. My Pieta. It's completely elegant. It's bafflingly beautiful. And it's capable of reducing the population of any standing structure to zero. I call it the Ex-Wife. That's the best I got. Are we gonna do this? Give me something here. You're like a sphinx. I can't read you.
James Rhodes / War Machine: I think I'll take it.
Justin Hammer: Which one?
James Rhodes / War Machine: All of it.
Justin Hammer: All of it.
[Scene change. Tony is looking through the box. Blue prints for the arc reactor. Newspaper articles. Video reels.]
Howard (on video): Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust heath, [Tony is flicking through a notebook as the video plays] and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. I'm Howard Stark, and everything you'll need for the future can be found right here. City of the Future? City of Tomorrow? City of  I'm Howard Stark and everything you'll need in the future can be found right here. So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I would like to personally  Tony, what are you doing back there? What is that? [Little Tony has picked one of the buildings up off the model.] Put that back. Put it back where you got it from. Where's your mother? Maria? Go on. Go, go, go, go. [A man takes little Tony off, presumably to where his mother is]
Man (out of sight): All right, I think we got 
Howard: I'll  I'll  I'll come in and  [Video changes]
Man: Are you waiting on me? [Howard drinks. Looks like whiskey. Video changes again]
Howard: So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I'd like to personally show you my ass. I'd like to  I can't  This is  I can't  We have this, don't we? This is a ridiculous way  Everything [Tony reaches end of notebook. Blank pages. Probably ones his father never got to fill in as he died] is achievable through technology. [Tony throws the book to one side and drinks] Tony. You're too young to understand this right now, so I thought I would put it on film for you. I built this for you. And someday you'll realise that it represents a whole lot more than just people's inventions. It represents my life's work. This is the key to the future. I'm limited by the technology of my time, but one day you'll figure this out. And when you do, you will change the world. What is and always will be my greatest creation is you. [Tony looks like he's about to cry as the film ends.
Scene change. He's driving down a road in car number plate Stark11
He stops to but some strawberries.]
Tony [Spanish]: How much?
Strawberry man: $6. Six.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I don't have any dough. Here. [Takes off watch]
Strawberry man: No, sir, that's too much.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: No, it's fine. Take that. It's fine
Strawberry man: No, señor.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Take it. Take it. I don't like people handing me things. If you just drop that there, that'd be great.
Strawberry man: Are you Iron Man?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Sometimes.
Strawberry man: [As Tony drives off] We believe in you!
[Now in Pepper's office]
Pepper Potts: It was an illegal seizure of trademark property.
PA: Miss Potts?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Relax.
PA: Mr Stark 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Is here.
PA: He refuses 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I don't. It's fine. I'll just be a second.
Pepper (on phone): Listen, it's our position that Stark has and continues to maintain propriety ownership of the Mark II platform.
News reporter (on telly): When Mr Stark announced he was indeed Iron Man, he was making a promise to America.
Pepper Potts: No, the suit belongs to us.
News reporter: We trusted that he would look out for us.
Pepper Potts: Yeah, but you're not 
News reporter: He obviously did not.
Pepper Potts: Burt 
News reporter: And now we learn that his secretary 
News reporter:  a woman named Virginia "Pepper" Potts, has been appointed as CEO of Stark Industries. What are her qualifications?
Pepper Potts: No.
News reporter: Miss Potts has done nothing to manage this terrible 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Mute.
Pepper Potts: No  Burt  Burt  Burt, listen to me. Don't tell me that we have the best patent lawyers in the country and then not let me pursue this.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [Looking at boxes and things in the corner.] I'll get this stuff out of here.
Pepper Potts: Well, then, tell the President to sign an order. We'll talk about it at the Expo. [Tony pulls back a sheet and finds the same model as that that was in the video with his father] Hammer's giving some presentation tomorrow evening. Will Tony Stark be there?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [Pulling up a chair] Will I?
Pepper Potts: No, he will not. Bye.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I would like to be. Got a minute?
Pepper Potts: No.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Come on, you just got off the phone. You're fine. 30 seconds.
Pepper Potts: Twenty-nine Twenty-eight.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I was just driving over here, and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I'm not.
Pepper Potts: You didn't come here to apologise?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Look, that goes without saying, and I'm working on that. But I haven't been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to try to make good. Can I move this? This is crazy. It's like a Ferris wheel, going. I'm trying to get some 
Pepper Potts: No.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Do you know how short life is? And if I never got to express  And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me. And I don't care  I mean, I care. It would be nice. I'm not expecting you to  Look, here's what I'm trying to say. I'm just gonna say it.
Pepper Potts: Let me stop you right here, okay? Because if you say "I" one more time, I'm gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think. I am trying to run a company. Do you have any idea what that entails?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yes.
Pepper Potts: People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you've disappeared, and all I'm doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat of it. I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do. Did you bring me strawberries? Did you know that there's only one thing on Earth that I'm allergic to?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Allergic to strawberries. This is progress Pepper. I knew there was a correlation between you and this.
Pepper Potts: I need you 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I need you too.
Pepper Potts:  to leave now
Tony Stark / Iron Man: That's what I'm trying to 
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: [Entering as Natalie in front of Happy] Ms Potts?
Pepper Potts: Hi, come on in.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Wheels up in 25 minutes.
Pepper Potts: Thank you.
Happy Hogan: Anything else, boss?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm good, Hap.
Pepper Potts: No, I'll be just another minute.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I lost both the kids in the divorce. [Tony looks over to Happy, who shakes his head.] Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here are Stark Enterprises? Your name is Natalie, isn't it? I thought you two didn't get along?
Pepper Potts: No. That's not so.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: It's just me you don't care for. No? Nothing?
Pepper Potts: Actually, while you're here maybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Absolutely. [Pepper and Happy leave] I'm surprised you can keep your mouth shut.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Boy, you're good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it? You just tear things  You're a triple imposter. I've never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you? Do you even speak Latin?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: [Latin]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected. [She leaves.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You're good. [Piles things up under desk spinny thing and throws strawberries in the bin. Goes back to the model and looks at it through one eye.
Scene change. Driving it home, fading into workshop]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame? I need a manipulatable projection.
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: 1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [Lifting the blue projection away from the model] How many buildings are there?
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Am I to include the Belgium waffle stands?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: That was rhetorical. Just show me. [Clicks his fingers and the model begins to spin and lifts upright] What does that look like to you Jarvis? Not unlike an atom. In which case the nucleus would be here. Highlight the unisphere. Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm discovering  Correction. I'm rediscovering a new element, I believe. Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees. [Tony flicks things away] Parking lots, exits, entrances. Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework. Dad. [The model now resembles a nucleus and Tony expands it.] Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school. [Tony snaps down so the model fits in his hand]
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Thank Dad.
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We're back in hardware mode.
[Smashing walls with sledge hammers, drilling holes in the floor, fiddling with wires, putting together pipes.
Agent Coulson enters]
Agent Phil Coulson: I heard you broke the perimeter.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah. That was, like, three years ago. Where have you been?
Agent Phil Coulson: I was doing some stuff.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah, well, me too and it worked. Hey, I'm playing for the home team Coulson, you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?
Agent Phil Coulson: [Pulls a familiar looking object out of a box] What's this doing here?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: That's it. Bring that to me.
Agent Phil Coulson: You know what this is?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [As Agent Coulson hands it to him] It's exactly what I need to make this work. Lift the coil. Go, go. Put your knees into it. There you go. And  Drop it. Drop it. [The shield is now in position and the coil straight.] Perfectly level. I'm busy. What do you want?
Agent Phil Coulson: Nothing. Goodbye. I've been reassigned. Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
Agent Phil Coulson: So I'm told.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Secret stuff?
Agent Phil Coulson: Something like that. Good luck.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Bye. Thanks. [They shake hands]
Agent Phil Coulson: We need you.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah, more than you know.
Agent Phil Coulson: Not that much. [He leaves. Tony goes back to building.]
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Initialising prismatic accelerator. [Tony turns a wheel on top] Approaching maximum power. [Using a wrench as a lever, the wheel is turned, but not before cutting holes in the wall. Eventually it's concentrated on a triangle which begins to glow blue.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: That was easy. [He removes the triangle using a pair of pliers]
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Congratulations sir. You have created a new element. [Placed into arc reactor] Sir, the reactor has accepted the modified core. I will begin running diagnostics.
[Scene change. Ivan is also building an arc reactor]
Justin (on phone from golf course): Hey Ivan. I got Senator Stern here. Thought we'd swing over and look at some of the drone designs.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: The drone is not going to be ready.
Justin Hammer: Not ready? What do you mean?
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: I can make presentation, not demonstration.
Justin Hammer: What the hell is the difference?
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: Presentation. No fly. No shoot.
Justin Hammer: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. What can you make them do? I mean, this is a weapons demonstration.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: I can make salute.
Justin Hammer: You can make salute? What do you mean "make salute"? What the hell does that mean Ivan? This is not what we agreed to, okay? You promised me suits and then you promised me drones. [Camera pans to show Ivan has remade his arc reactor whips]
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: Hey, man, everything will be okay.
Justin Hammer: This is not what I wanted.
[Justin is back at Hammer Industries. Enters Ivan's room with two men.]
Justin Hammer: Hey, there he is. It's the bird man. Now you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I'm confused. You said it wasn't, but now it looks like you're the best of pals. You love that bird, don't you? You know what? Take the bird.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: [As man grabs bird] Hey!
Justin Hammer: Take his pillows too. Both of them. And his shoes. Take his shoes. I took your stuff. How does that make you feel? Do you feel bad? Good. ‘Cause that's how I feel! We had a contract. I saved your life and you give me suits. That was our deal. And you did not deliver. I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud. I don't know what you are. Something really, really great fell into my lap. And if it hadn't, I'd be at your mercy tonight. Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself. And now your overpriced paperweights and gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration. Do you dig what I'm getting at here?
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: [Russian] ты слишком много говоришь. [no subs in the movie;You talk too much.]
Justin Hammer: I don't know if you know this, but I don't speak Russian! I'm gonna leave now. I'm gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I'll even get laid. You see these guys? They're your babysitters. They are not to be trifled with. When I get back, we're gonna renegotiate the terms of our agreement. And you're gonna make good on our arrangement because if you don't, you're gonna be exactly what you were when I found you, a dead man. You got that? Maybe you can watch me on TV. [Leaves]
[Tony's house]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Dummy, You, can we clean up this mess? You're killing me. You know I don't 
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Incoming call with a blocked number sir.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely. Coulson. How's the Land of Enchantment?
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: Hey, Tony, how you doing? I double cycle.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You what?
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: You told me double cycle's more power. Good advice.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: You too.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [mutes his speaker] Trace him.
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Sir.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: Now, the true history of Stark name will be written.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Jarvis, where is he?
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Accessing the Oracle grid. Eastern Seaboard.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: What your father did to my family over 40 years, I will do to you in 40 minutes.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Sounds good. Let's get together and hash it out.
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Tri-State area. Manhattan and outlying boroughs.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: I hope you're ready. [Call ends]
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Call trace incomplete.
[Sees advert for Justin's presentation. Picks up new arc reactor]
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Sir
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You want to run some tests, run them. And assemble the suit while you're at it. Put it together now.
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: We are unclear as to the effects.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I don't want to hear it Jarvis. [Reactor gains power] That tastes like coconut. And metal. Oh wow, yeah!
[Stark Expo. Natasha opens the door for Pepper to exit the car]
Happy Hogan: I'll keep the car down here, all right?
Pepper Potts: Thank you Happy.
Announcer:  Justin Hammer. His presentation will begin shortly in the main pavilion.
[Begins. Justin dances on to the stage]
Justin Hammer: Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Thanks for coming. Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long, this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm's way, but then the Iron Man arrived, and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us. Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach. That's not fair. That's not right. And it's just too bad.
Pepper Potts: Oh, Lord.
Justin Hammer: Regardless, it was an impressive innovation, one that grabbed the headlines the world over. Well, today, my friends, the press is faced with quite a difficult problem. They are about to run out of ink. [Two people run on to remove the podium] Get that out of here. Ladies and gentlemen, today I present to you the new face of the United States military. The Hammer drone. [Drones rise out of the stage as he calls names] Army! Navy! Air Force! Marines! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! That's a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you. But as revolutionary as this technology is, there will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war [Ivan is typing something] Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud to present to you the very first prototype in the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit and its pilot, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.
Pepper Potts: What? [Rises and salutes.]
Justin Hammer: For America and its allies, Hammer Industries is reporting for  [incoming Iron Man]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: We got trouble.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Tony, there are civilians present. I'm here on orders. Let's not do this right now.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Give them a wave.
Justin Hammer: Hey, all right. Yeah.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here. You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Listen, I think he's working with Vanko.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Vanko's alive?
Justin Hammer: Yeah. [Tony approaches him]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: What is he?
Justin Hammer: What?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Where's Vanko?
Justin Hammer: Who?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Tell me.
Justin Hammer: What are you doing here man?
James Rhodes / War Machine: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [As a large gun takes aim] Is that you?
James Rhodes / War Machine: No, I'm not doing that. That's not me. I can't move. I'm locked up. I'm locked up! [Drones take aim] Get out of here. Go! This whole system's been compromised.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [Takes off] Let's take it outside. [Drones and Rhodey fire at him. Rhodey takes off]
James Rhodes / War Machine: No, no!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Yes sir.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Tony, Tony, I'm locked on. I have target lock.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: On what?
James Rhodes / War Machine: On you. [Shooting at Tony] Tony, on your six!
Justin Hammer: [Running to a computer] What's going on? What's happening?
Technician: The software's been overridden.
Justin Hammer: What? What do you mean it's been overridden? What does that mean?
Technician: I think he slaved the drones.
Justin Hammer: That's impossible. Call the guards.
Jack: All the phones are down sir.
Justin Hammer: Well, then call their  Call their cells.
Jack: Their cell phones are not working either sir.
Technician: He's locked us out of the mainframe.
Pepper Potts: [Entering] Who's locked you out of the mainframe?
Justin Hammer: Please, please, go away. Go away. I've got this handled.
Pepper Potts: Have you now?
Justin Hammer: Yes, I do. In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up, this wouldn't be happening. So, please, now go away. Thank you [To technician] Listen, we got to get these bitches out of here. What?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: [Grabs Justin and holds him down on the desk] You tell me who's behind this. Who's behind this?
Justin Hammer: Ivan. Ivan Vanko.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Where is he?
Justin Hammer: At my facility.
[Natasha lets go and leaves. Pepper dials a number on her phone]
Pepper Potts: I need NYPD, please.
Justin Hammer: No, no, no!
Pepper Potts: Command Central.
Justin Hammer: No, no, honey. Don't call the authorities.
Pepper Potts: Okay. Right away. Right away. [To Justin] Step aside. Step aside. [To technician] Tell me everything you know. Go.
[Tony is still being chased by Rhodey's suit and the air force drones]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: How are we doing Jarvis?
J.A.R.V.I.S. / Vision: Remote reboot unsuccessful.
[Other drones are now firing at the running crowds. Natasha leaves the building.]
Security guard: This way.
Happy Hogan: Nobody's answering the phone. What's going on?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.
Happy Hogan: I'm not taking you anywhere.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Fine. You want me to drive?
Happy Hogan: No, I'm driving. Get in the car.
[Lots of shooting drones and people screaming. The kid with the Iron Man helmet is targeted by a drone and holds his hand up. Tony lands behind him and shoots the drone with his hand repulsor]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Nice work kid. [Takes off again]
James Rhodes / War Machine: You got multiples coming in on you.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Let's get this away from the Expo.
[Inside car]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Wen we arrive, I need you to watch the perimeter. [She's getting undressed in the back of the car] I'm gonna enter the facility and take down the target. Watch the road.
Happy Hogan: I got it. I got it.
[Tony and Rhodey. Tony sets off one car alarm, the drones set off the rest.
Ivan is still typing inside Hammer Industries]
James Rhodes / War Machine: Listen, listen. A pack just peeled off. They're headed back to the Expo.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Got it.
James Rhodes / War Machine: In closing in on you. Ordnance coming in hot Tony. Watch it.
[Hammer Industries. Happy parks the car outside. More of less]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Stay in the car.
Happy Hogan: I'm not staying in the car.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: I said, stay in the car.
Happy Hogan: [As Natasha heads up the stairs to the front door] What are you wearing? Look, I'm not letting you go in there alone.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: You want to help? Keep the car running.
Happy Hogan: [Opens the door as she unlocks it and runs in] Okay.
[Ivan gets a security breach message]
Hammer security guard: Hey, hey, hey. You can't come in here.
[Happy punches him and Natasha heads past.]
Second guard: Hold on. Hey!
[Natasha fights the other guards. Some using her SHIELD tech, some just kicking or punching them.
Back at Expo]
Technician: Each set of drone is communicating in its own unique language.
Pepper Potts: Well, choose one and focus on that.
Justin Hammer: Have you tried Russian? Why don't you try Russian?
[Hammer Industries. Happy is still fighting the same guard.]
Announcement: Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.
Security guard: We got it. We're on our way.
[And Natasha throws something. And takes on like five guards at once. She walks away, casually spraying one with pepper spray. All this while Happy's fighting one guy. Happy wins.]
Happy Hogan: I got him! [Sees what Natasha has done
Ivan gets up.
Tony is trying to let the drones away]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Rhodey, you still locked on?
James Rhodes / War Machine: Yeah.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We're about to get wet on this ride.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Wait, wait, wait!
[Tony leads the drones through the globe sculpture. Most explode hitting parts of it.
Natasha kicks open Ivan's door, a gun in each hand. Happy is behind her. The room is empty.]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: He's gone.
[Tony and Rhodey]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm sorry buddy. Had to thin out the herd. What's your 20?
[Directly above him. Both crash into biodome
Natasha puts her guns on the table and starts typing.]
Happy Hogan: What are you doing?
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.
[Rhodey is on top of Tony, who is pushing the gun to keep it from shooting him]
James Rhodes / War Machine: Tony.
[Natasha gains access.
Rhodey's suit shuts down]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Reboot complete [Image of Tony on screen] You got your best friend back.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Well done on the new chest piece. I am reading significant higher output and your vitals all look promising.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yes, for the moment, I'm not dying. Thank you.
Pepper Potts: [Image appears on second screen] What do you mean you're not dying? Did you just say you're dying?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Is that you? No, I'm not. Not anymore. [Natasha looks confused.]
Pepper Potts: What's going on?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I was going to tell you. I didn't want to alarm you.
Pepper Potts: You were gonna tell me? You really were dying?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You didn't let me.
Pepper Potts: Why didn't you tell me that?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon. You got incoming Tony. Looks like the fight's coming to you.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Great. Pepper?
Pepper Potts: Are you okay now?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I am fine. Don't be mad. I will formally apologise 
Pepper Potts: I am mad!
Tony Stark / Iron Man:  when I'm not fending off a Hammeroid attack.
Pepper Potts: Fine.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: We could have been in Venice.
Pepper Potts: Oh please.
[Tony taps Rhodey's helmet as the system restarts.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Rhodes? Snap out of it buddy. I need you. They're coming. Come on, let's roll. Get up.
James Rhodes / War Machine: [Helmet opens] Oh, man. You can have your suit back.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [Helps him up] You okay?
James Rhodes / War Machine: Yeah, thanks. Tony, look, I'm sorry, okay?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Don't be.
James Rhodes / War Machine: No. I should have trusted you more.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I'm the one who put you in this position. Forget it.
James Rhodes / War Machine: No. It's your fault. I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear. Partner. They're coming in hot, any second. What's the play?
James Rhodes / War Machine: Well, we want to take the high ground, okay? So let's put the biggest gun up on that ridge.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Got you. Where do you want to be?
James Rhodes / War Machine: Where are you going?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: What're you talking about?
James Rhodes / War Machine: I meant me.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You have a big gun. You are not the big gun.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Tony, don't be jealous.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: No. It's subtle all the bells and whistles.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Yeah. It's called being a badass.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Fine. All right. You go up to. I'll draw them in.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Don't stay down here. This is the worst place to be.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Okay, you got a spot. Where's mine?
James Rhodes / War Machine: It's the kill box, Tony. Okay This is where you go to die. [Drones incoming. And Rhodey and Ton are still in the kill box. Helmets down. Shooting begins.]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: See that?
James Rhodes / War Machine: Yeah, yeah. Nice.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Rhodey? Get down. [Laser slices all the drones in half. And a tree.]
James Rhodes / War Machine: Wow. I think you should lead with that next time.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah. Sorry boss. I can only use it one. It's a one-off.
[Back inside Expo]
Justin Hammer: I told you that five minutes ago.
Pepper Potts: [As police enter] That's your guy here.
Justin Hammer: Excuse me?
Police officer: You're being placed under arrest.
Justin Hammer: Are you kidding me?
Police officer: Hands behind your back sir.
Justin Hammer: I'm trying to help here. I get it. I see what you're doing. You're trying to pin this on me, huh? That's good. That's good. You're starting to think like a CEO, taking out the competition. I like that. You think you're making a problem for me? [Being led away] I'm gonna make a problem for you. I'm gonna be seeing you again real soon.
Pepper Potts: [Now outside with some police officers] When they get here, I think you should station them at the south, east and both west exits.
Police officer: We shut down the 7 train in and out of Willets Point already.
Pepper Potts: Well, have city buses there to ferry people to operating lines.
Police officer: Yeah. Are you coming with us?
Pepper Potts: No, I'm gonna stay until to park is clear.
Police officer: Okay.
[Hammer Industries]
Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: Head up. You got one more drone incoming. This one looks different. [Tony and Rhodey; Natasha on speaker] The repulsor signature is significantly higher.
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: [Landing in a full suit] Good to be back.
James Rhodes / War Machine: This ain't gonna be good. [Ivan's whisps turn on] I got something special for this guy. I'm gonna bust his bunker with the Ex-Wife.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: With the what? [Rhodey shoots it and it bounces off Ivan, fizzling off in the water] Hammer tech?
James Rhodes / War Machine: Yeah.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I got this. [Targets points on Ivan's armour. Doesn't do much. Both shooting, fighting. Ends with both Tony and Rhodey held onto by Ivan's whips] Rhodes. I got an idea. You want to be a hero?
James Rhodes / War Machine: What?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I could really use a sidekick. Put your hand up.
James Rhodes / War Machine: This is your idea?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yep.
James Rhodes / War Machine: I'm ready. I'm ready. Go, go, go!
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Take it! [Same as at the house, they shoot each other and the middle explodes. Unfortunately for Ivan, he is in the middle]
Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: You lose. [Dies. Reactor starts flashing red. So do all the drones]
James Rhodes / War Machine: All these drones are rigged to blow. We gotta get out of here man.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Pepper? [Takes off. Pepper is by a drone. Tony grabs her just as it explodes. They land on a roof. Takes off helmet.]
Pepper Potts: Oh my God. I can't take this anymore.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You can't?
Pepper Potts: I can't take this.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Look at me.
Pepper Potts: My body, literally, cannot handle the stress. I never know if you're gonna kill yourself or wreak the whole company.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I think I did okay. [Everything being on fire having been covered by exploding drones behind him. One more explosion. Just as he finishes speaking.]
Pepper Potts: I quit. I'm resigning. That's it.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: What did you just say? You're done? That's surprising. No, it's not surprising. I get it. You don't have to make excuses.
Pepper Potts: I'm  I'm  I'm not making any excuses.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You actually were just making excuses. But you don't have to.
Pepper Potts: No, I wasn't making an excuse. I'm actually very justified.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Listen. Hey, hey. You deserve better.
Pepper Potts: Well 
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You've taken such good care of me. I've been in a tough spot, but you got me through it, so  Right?
Pepper Potts: Thank you.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah.
Pepper Potts: Thank you for understanding.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah, yeah. Let's talk clean-up.
Pepper Potts: I'll handle the transition. It'll be smooth.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Okay. What about the press? Because you only had the job for a week. That's gonna seem 
Pepper Potts: Well, with you it's like dog years.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I know.
Pepper Potts: I mean, it's like the Presidency. [They kiss]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Weird.
Pepper Potts: No, it's not weird.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: It's okay, right?
Pepper Potts: Yeah.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Run that by me again. [They start to kiss again]
James Rhodes / War Machine: I think it was weird. [They break apart and turn around] You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.
Pepper Potts: I had just quit, actually.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Yeah, so we're not 
James Rhodes / War Machine: You don't have to do that. I heard the whole thing.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You should get lost.
James Rhodes / War Machine: I was here first. Get a roof.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: I thought you were out of one-liners.
James Rhodes / War Machine: That's the last one.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: You kicked ass back there, by the way.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Thank you. You too. Listen, my car got taken out in the explosion, so I'm gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?
Tony Stark / Iron Man: Not okay. Not okay with that.
James Rhodes / War Machine: It wasn't a question. [Takes off]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: How are you gonna resign if I don't accept?
[Scene change. Some kind of building. Tony is inside sitting at a table. SHIELD logo is there.
Picks up file. AVENGERS INITIATIVE PREMLIMIARY REPORT
Nick Fury enters while looking and stops him opening it]
Nick Fury: I don't think I want you looking at that. I'm not sure it pertains to you anymore. Now this on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff's assessment of you. Read it. [Hands Tony the file]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: "Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour." In my own defence, that was last week. "Prone to self-destructive tendencies." I was dying. I mean, please. Aren't we all? "Textbook narcissism"? Agreed. Okay, here it is. "Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes." I gotta think about it.
Nick Fury: Read on.
Tony Stark / Iron Man: "Tony Stark not  Not recommended"? That doesn't make any sense. How can you approve me but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I'm trying to do right by Pepper. I'm in a stable-ish relationship. [Fury walks round and rest against the table by Tony's chair]
Nick Fury: Which leads us to believe at this juncture we'd only like to use you as a consultant. [Tony stands and offers his hand. They shake]
Tony Stark / Iron Man: [Clasping his other hand on top of Fury's] You can't afford me. [Goes to leave, but turns around again] Then again, I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour. Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter.
Nick Fury: I'll see what I can do.
[Scene change. Washington. ACDC's Highway To Hell Starts to play]
Senator Stern: It is my honour to be here today to present these distinguished awards to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes and Mr Tony Stark, who is, of course, a national treasure. [Pinning on medals] Thank you Lieutenant Colonel, for such and exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this.
James Rhodes / War Machine: Thank you sir.
Senator Stern: Mr Stark. Thank you for such as exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this. [Tony winces in pain] Oh, sorry. Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn't it? Let's get a photo.
